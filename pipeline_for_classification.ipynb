      "not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party\n",
      "love this thing works great and kids love it to\n",

      "love it. works great making my home a smarthome\n",
      "i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  when i got everything set up, i realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  all it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  it will not change colors.  you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  i wish i’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.\n",
      "i would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.\n",

      "alexa is easy to operate and set up.  have had it for about 10 days now and love it.\n",
      "i am guilty of not setting this up, i had my youngest daughter do it. she did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out. so i would have to assume it was not very difficult. i have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself.\n",
      "it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.\n",
      "still learning all the ways to use it.  it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  very cute.\n",
      "we bot 2 on prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  music sound is very good not as good as the echo but way better than our dots.  if we could only buy 1 amazon device it would be the spot.\n",
      "love alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time\n",
      "very bad this device, i don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. when you talk you have to yell super lauded\n",
      "\n",
      "i am happy with the refurbished echo dot. i’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! i’m happy with this purchase!\n",
      "i love my echo!  works just like they said it would. i don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so i cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.\n",
      "very good quality\n",
      "i like it alot. i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather & time every morning. i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this. i'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it. definitely worth the money.\n",
      "love, love this new little gadget.  has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  we hardly need our cd's anymore, since alexa plays everything we need.  going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms.  thanks!!\n",
      "works. replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.it took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.maybe it should said something during the setup process.\n",
      "works great! i recommend it to anyone who has prime, wifi and an hdm1 tv. that’s all u need. i’m not really technologically savvy but even i was able to set it up with included and on screen directions.\n",
      "purchased this for a discount on prime day to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot. works great, love it! now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me, and i mostly use it for music. this is our 3rd echo product and we love them!\n",
      "great and easy to use\n",
      "great product!\n",
      "i enjoy the various functions of the device\n",
      "met every expectation i had\n",
      "i love it, i can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. sound is good and i can stop it with a voice command if i get a phone call.\n",
      "great sound from a little speaker\n",
      "i really haven’t found any difference between this and the original version i bought. they both work great\n",
      "the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.\n",
      "bought two of them and both work great. i'm not much on electronics running my home, but alexa does all that i want and need to be done.\n",
      "my daughter has an echo show and she told me how much she loved it. i bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  it has all the features of the others plus great extras. the sound system is awesome. i also own the original echo tower, dots and spot. each are great and have their uses around my house. i highly recommend all of these products.\n",
      "had to return it as hulu does not work on device.  it kept coming up with errors, and hulu app not being able to open at times.  it was hit and miss, and at times, hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps.\n",
      "alexa hardly came on..\n",
      "this product just looks adorable in any room and i love it. i recently just bought my mom one as a gift on prime day and she can't wait to use it.\n",
      "great product. had a bit of a problem to download kodi but once it is done. you get all the movies tv programs.\n",
      "works fine, i wanted this for my bedroom television.\n",
      "love this thing. people think i’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. but i don’t care!! for me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! so glad i don’t have to deal with my old eeaanh eeaanh eeaanh alarm. very excited to say “alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.\n",
      "the first stick is a solid, entry level, device and does what it's supposed to do.\n",
      "of course!\n",
      "this is my first digital assistant so i'm giving this a good review. speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day. fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (that's what i was going to get in the first place, but i ended up with echo). if you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!what i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. my purchase came with a smart plug for $10 which i connect my lamp to. alexa, turn of the lights!\n",
      "i live alone, this is the best companion!\n",
      "took me awhile to get it connected. i'm not electronically savy but now that it is, i love it.\n",
      "i agree ...youtube should be on there.\n",
      "love my new addition to the house! speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa. my only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. example: for our smart lights in the house. unless we specify kitchen light 1 or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. it may be me, but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards. i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. i know it sounds odd. we laugh about it, but maybe it’s a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too.\n",
      "very pleased with the echo 2nd generation. it is so nice to have alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.\n",
      "i have not had it very long. it's my first alexa thing. i sure like what i have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with\n",
      "it is awesome. i love being able to turn my lights on so i don’t have to walk into a dark home. i also get to video chat with my nephews who live states away by just asking alexa to call.\n",
      "love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. if it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. they thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so i bought a dedicated speaker for the echo. proved to be best way to go.\n",
      "i like the echo spot because it fits into my decor and i can also sing along with my favorite songs\n",
      "great to play music throughout the house. great and easily fits in my decor of my home\n",
      "tried to play certain broadway shows like camelot and it gives ne the group camelot.\n",
      "i bought this because it can control fios television. it works well. i’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. then i discovered all the other things alexa can do. play music you ask for. great sound from alexa. play games. play radio stations. play old time radio programs like the long ranger. alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. the other day i played madlibs. great fun. also alexa can control household appliances. i just purchased alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and tv components. i’m looking forward to implementing this controll. you can also add other alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\n",
      "i love the size and the videos are a good quality.  the sound is awesome too.\n",
      "very capable.  language recognition is the best i've experienced.  great sound, too!\n",
      "love alexa!!  i own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!\n",
      "so awesome to bring my older tv to life\n",
      "have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great\n",
      "great product. more skills are needed. i love it.\n",
      "it's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything i ask but it's still nice to use.\n",
      "easy set up\n",
      "great prime day buy!\n",
      "got it and, as expected, its great! almost a swell as my show.\n",
      "love it. thanks amazon. you guys rock!!\n",
      "no enough video options\n",
      "just what i expected....\n",
      "i’m not sure why or how amazonia asking me about this purchase. i got it as a gift from my kids for mother’s day...  it was not bought from my account. lil bit creepy 😑. i haven’t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. so that part meh. the other things it does are no different than the other alexa products.\n",
      "really like it\n",
      "awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. great purchase.\n",
      "this is our first step into a smart home. soon as i added one item to the grocery list i started loving it. my wife was so-so about it ‘til i opened rain sounds. she’s a convert. 😉 love these and the dots.\n",
      "works great! killer speaker! my wife and son love it.\n",
      "powerful little stick\n",
      "tremendous way to communicate with friends and family all across the country\n",
      "we put one in the bedroom.  it plays music and tells us the weather.  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  it is better than a clock radio.  it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  it can even tell jokes.  i don't know how i got along without it before now.  amazing.\n",
      "what a great little gadget for the house. you ask and it delivers, period. well done!\n",
      "bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  she loves it!!  i especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!\n",
      "love this!\n",
      "\n",
      "i love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.\n",

      "it works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend\n",
      "sounds great have not used the hub yet\n",
      "using it to stream amazon prime and netflix.\n",
      "the echo is an amazing device.  many times it seems very intuitive.  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  installation was fairly straightforward, but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out.  my advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms (which i am told can be done).  however, i can't make any of the echos aware of the others existence.  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  i know this is likely my fault, but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  a small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\n",
      "i like it as an alexa device but its small.\n",
      "works fine, i just realize i don’t need this because i don’t use it.\n",
      "love my echo great sound very smart!\n",
      "this thing is way cool!  you should get one.  if you want to be cool, that is.\n",
      "not working\n",
      "item no longer works after just 5 months of use. will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.\n",
      "works as advertised. speak clearly, and research the commands. also. get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. for some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha\n",
      "alread had echos and dots, but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on prime day.  another fun product from amazon.\n",
      "really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.\n",
      "great sound\n",
      "great! just like new!\n",
      "lovee it! it has evrything i need it, now i cant even get my dad out of my room hahahaha... movie addicts.\n",
      "i love my echo smart speaker.  i love the volume and clarity.  it was easy to set up.  its a wonderful gift for any age.\n",
      "i jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an echo.  i feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  still testing it out.\n",
      "easy to setup.  sometimes alexis does not work the greatest. the connection fire stick and wifi is way bettter than netflix .\n",
      "already had an echo dot. the echo is even better with fuller sound. also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!\n",
      "great price.  i love my echo dot,\n",
      "really disappointed alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  my fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  if i could return it, i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa.\n",
      "love the echo show.  being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!\n",
      "all is fine with the spot exact for one massive failing.  in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  yes, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "so far i’m very pleased with my echo show.  the problem is, there’s so much it can do that i haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! i got the special price as part of the prime day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  very pleased with the sound. the video screen is sharp. sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a command...but as i get to know the system better, i’m hoping that will improve.  one drawback in the music...i’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  example: secret agent man by johnny rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  if i’m going to pay for prime music...i’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear.  otherwise, i am very pleased with my echo show.  so pleased in fact, that i bought a second one!\n",
      "having the large screen really majes this an enjoyable experience. only thing it’s missing is youtube.\n",

      "i was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with amazon's guarantee, thought i would try it. glad i did, and will probably buy another refurb product form amazon. i love the alexa products and have several. this one sits on my desk. has a small footprint, but has great sound and i use it daily. works great.\n",
      "easy to use and has great sound...it was a great purchase at a great price.\n",
      "kids love it! i love it!\n",

      "well-made product.echo spot - white\n",
      "eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring i don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. i can’t connect to my spotify unless it’s premium and i’m in college and i’m not paying or that or amazon music so\n",
      "love my echo show!\n",

      "my favorite echo. a more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.\n",
      "if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echo/dot units simultaneously, you must pay a monthly fee. i thought this was amazon, not apple??!! i’ve paid for many of these so i could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??\n",
      "i love it, wife hates it.\n",
      "amazing for all your entertainment needs!\n",

      "the packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! we have 2 dots and an echo plus already. now we have the show and we love it. an echo for each room!you can also say &#34;alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. this is good for sleeping.\n",

      "although this is my second echo device, i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  i purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  or at least point out where it can be found...\n",
      "easy to set up, can control kasa smart plugs no problem.  even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa, like telling jokes and singing. the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\n",
      "got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.it’s far from being useful.half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. basically ignoring you. often she is unable to answer basic questions.it’s been so frustrating. alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.i would return it but i’m past the return period...... zzzz\n",

      "i am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. but...omg this is by far the coolest thing i have ever had.  it does everything short of clean your house... which, when i asked alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn’t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  from reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my bose bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and i am sure. million more things!buy it.....you u will not regret it.\n",

      "unit is working great, but it is a true pia that products today are shipped without user manuals. do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? i have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. i have it linked to my hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. i purchased a fire tv stick along with the show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. just a few examples.i even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.\n",
      "its great. lots of fun!!\n",
      "is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app. i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.\n",

      "we got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. will update. playing music is great though!\n",
      "i received the echo in perfect condition. the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. alexa is a great addition to our family!\n",
      "fun taking to the tv. works good. it’s a little confusing moving around the programs.\n",
      "great technology!! can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. wish i had bought another one!\n",
      "awesome!! loving alexa\n",
      "love my echo dot easy to use and set up\n",
      "too difficult to set up.  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password\n",
      "love all the options with the fire tv stick!works great!\n",
      "it's like siri, in fact, siri answers more accurately then alexa.  i don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\n",
      "she works well. needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. alexa “learn” tasha’s birthday.  or alexa “learn” my definition of fine. etc. other than that she is great\n",
      "i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  i think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  i also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\n",
      "works great. bought as a gift for my boyfriend. easy & fun to use.\n",
      "i really love that all my apps are in one spot\n",
      "i don't like how i cannot load my hulu account, it is also very slow. i know it is not my internet connection because i have an xbox one that works just fine, but my fire tv stick takes forever to load anything.\n",
      "more compact and a bit better than the original\n",
      "i love it.  it is so easy to use\n",
      "i'm so happy that i purchased alexa.  when i recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  i love the sound & love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  i haven't been able to listen to my cd's for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer.\n",
      "it won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work\n",
      "my kids love alexa... skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions\n",
      "i love this thing! it plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! if you’re considering purchasing one, get it. it’s worth it.\n",
      "when we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? well, i'm so glad we did! we are really enjoying our echo spot. it reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  it's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.\n",
      "i was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  it looks good, so far.  i did, however, turn off the camera.\n",
      "got this as a gift and love it. i never would have bought one for myself, but now that i have it.... allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.\n",
      "great, love it!\n",
      "do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  it rarely gets what i say correct, does not control the dish receiver.  yes i set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  we got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  maybe in another month it will get better, or either i have one that is just deaf and dumb.  really can not recommend this item at the current time\n",
      "does not work all the time\n",
      "this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. thank you!\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "the echo plus works as expected but i never received the philips hue smart bulb that was supposed to be included as part of my purchase. please advise.\n",
      "i'm still learning how to use it, but so far my echo is great! the sound is actually much better than i was expecting.\n",
      "works like a champ.\n",
      "if you don't have an echo you definitely need one\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "we have a few echos already. went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. it works great. i love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.\n",
      "the echo dot was everything that i expected and more.\n",
      "easy to use, all your favorite programs. all inclusive, nothing else to buy.\n",
      "love the fire stick. alexa works well on it too. would recommend.\n",
      "i bought this for a family member as a gift. i called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️\n",
      "no habla espanol\n",
      "sure did !! love it !!\n",
      "so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity\n",
      "works really well.\n",
      "we have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when i am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!\n",
      "this is my third dot. they all work perfectly and i use each one multiple times a day. absolutely love them.\n",
      "i love it it is awesome\n",
      "my wife has been using skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  since her father is 88, it's a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure skype, but he does.  when i saw these on sale, i jumped on them.  my wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but i told her these just work - like the video phones i saw at the new york world's fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  my wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.  it just works, like a telephone - imagine that.\n",
      "this product is easy to use and very entertaining.  i have yet to hook it up to my tv or lights but look forward to doing so.\n",
      "clear sound, great alarm clock, plays my music.  what else can you ask for.  oh yeah, you can order what you need.\n",
      "small footprint.  nice clarity.\n",
      "being able to use it with my alexa echo was great!\n",
      "oh i love my echo show and the video news spots\n",
      "great product. so many features.\n",
      "easy setup. alexa needs a lot of training,\n",

      "\n",
      "absolutely love it!\n",
      "got this as a gift... so cool!  i can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  and much more!!!\n",
      "amazing\n",
      "the selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice. i wish, however, it didn't keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my tv.  i have to keep switching back after any switches in programming, including my stereo.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "we are loving ours very much\n",
      "\n",
      "still learning how to ise it but is does not disappoint. i’m giving to everyone for christmas so i can “check in” on them unnannounced like they do me...just show up with no advanced warning!!!\n",
      "streaming is easy.  i love it because i can watch netflix in my bedroom on my tv and not my ipad\n",
      "i love searching the alexa skill shop on the app. useful things like having alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. and fun stuff like telling alexa to make the star trek red alert nois. or playing song quiz with friends.\n",
      "love it. added it to an upstairs bedroom\n",
      "i took advantage of prime friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  i enjoy the features it comes with. i'm sorry i didn't purchase two of them  well worth the money.  its looks great on my nightstand.  every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  happy customer!\n",
      "very cool product. easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than i anticipated.\n",
      "i wanted to see my security video cameras without having to use my phone. works great and extremely easy to set up.\n",
      "using as a hub and music.\n",
      "love that you can use your cell phone to call echo or dot. you can also use echo and dot as intercoms.\n",
      "bought two of these. one for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room. its great if i need a recipe or need to know how to do something.  i am still learning everything it can do.\n",
      "i bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like i thought it would. it doesn't alert us when someone is at the door. also, i can't talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone.\n",
      "bought this on prime day\n",
      "i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google. only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. easy to use.\n",
      "alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time\n",
      "funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  loving it!!\n",
      "love this wished i had gotten it sooner\n",
      "😍\n",
      "love it getting use to it and alexa is getting use to my voice . sometimes she doesn't answer but i think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. over all i haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. thank goodness i didn't listen to those reviews.  and paid attention to the apple guy .\n",
      "sound quality is great. still learning about all the different things i can do with it. fun!!!\n",
      "good hearing range and sound quality. it was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when i am speaking slowly and clearly but i love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.\n",
      "love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. i don't have hours to research websites. plus, more instruction from alexa on skills would be great. we often get the answer, \"i don't know that skill\" even though i've added it in the app. i.e. kwikset or pizza hut.\n",
      "i love my fire stick thank you so much\n",
      "it is just not as loud as i thought it was going to be.\n",
      "works perfect no wear and tear on the device i love alexa working on making my home smart 😂\n",
      "great product. very versatile and easy to use\n",
      "i have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. i set morning alarms, check the weather, have alexa play various music (i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and i'm learning her skills. a little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. so far, super satisfied. will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.\n",
      "it’s amazing i love it\n",
      "\n",
      "i love my echo smart speaker.  i love the volume and clarity.  it was easy to set up.  its a wonderful gift for any age.\n",
      "it's so efficient and amazing!  how cool!  we all use it often every day...\n",
      "great product. love the larger remote! great deal!\n",
      "the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. i was not aware of that.  disappointed\n",
      "works as expected\n",
      "have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have.\n",
      "it’s awesome\n",
      "super good!\n",
      "great price, works perfectly. saved the money on a refurb!! would buy again!\n",
      "this is the best alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. it sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. the screen makes all the difference in the world.\n",
      "just getting started with the fire tv stick. so far, so good.\n",
      "i put it on a tv that didn’t have a great picture and it now looks like a new tv\n",
      "very disappointed.  alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.\n",
      "the menu''s are cumbersome to get your apps set up.\n",
      "great product except there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time permanently.  when in 'clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'things to try' screen.  i intended on buying several units for my house, but i do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  acting as clock should be a basic feature of the echo spot.  how could you get this wrong, amazon??  #fail\n",
      "i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.\n",
      "\n",
      "easy to install and use.\n",
      "cool\n",
      "love my new alexa. she works great so far.\n",
      "there was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep i spoke with could fix. the replacement was registered to someone else. when the price of the dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), i bought a brand, spanking new one. no problem with the new one.\n",
      "great\n",
      "great\n",
      "not good at all!\n",
      "i love the sound very good. we use it for home automation also works well!!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "the sound on these is terrible. it’s like a tin can. i love my echo but this item is awful.\n",
      "great product i just wish it had some sort of equalizer... the bass is a little much\n",
      "amazing. it has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.\n",
      "love my echo spot!\n",
      "works wonderfully.\n",
      "great. definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 i can't really regret it at all. love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to the smiths.\n",
      "i'm an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i've always loved it. i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus. let me tell you what, great choice! as much as i love my original echo, the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. the sound is great. and the fact that it's got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus!\n",
      "love it!  so do the grandkids!!\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "i was pleasantly surprised! it’s awesome so far\n",
      "very cool!\n",
      "small device that my kids like to ask questions. very handy friendly interactive\n",
      "easy to set up and connect with smart devices. just what i needed!\n",
      "i like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the google. only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. easy to use.\n",
      "puts the pep back in my old tv.  all of the software was expired and i enjoy netflix and amazon prime video.  now i have all of my favorite video on the tv again......\n",
      "\n",
      "wish volume was capable of going louder\n",
      "thumbs up!\n",
      "i am quite disappointed by this product.there clearly is a bug: half of the time i ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. same goes when i ask to play the radio. also, many times it get confused when i ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. clearly no ai or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. not impressed!\n",
      "love it. i got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. we love it.\n",
      "great improvement over the original echo.  like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch prime tv and get other visuals.  the little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination.\n",
      "i love this thing. at first i thought it wouldn’t stay on the clock and that i would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it’s very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. love it\n",
      "i liked the sound . what is troubling is that i paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. sometimes it doesn't work. ex. alexa play italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera tosca, response &#34;sorry i don&#34;t have that.\n",
      "really disappointed alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  my fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  if i could return it, i would as my apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the alexa.\n",
      "it’s fun\n",
      "worked perfect\n",
      "i had a brand new echo dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. it was quite different from my expectations. refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while i realized that the power adapter was faulty. there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.update: amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. this is why i shop on amazon. i can always trust them to deliver on their products.\n",
      "i having it in my living room. music sounds really good in my living room . i can hear it upstairs.\n",
      "great addition to my echo plus!\n",
      "i had just said to myself how i desired an assistant when i came across the spot!  as a mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own. i just verbally tell alexa what reminder or timer i need set and voila!having my spot has given me the virtual assistant i so desired without having to actually hire someone.  not to mention the many other awesome features. i have alexa synced with my audible & kindle & alex can read a book from my libraries to me.i’m still excited to see what else my spot can do!side note: i had wanted to purchase a show for a while & probably still will down the line however i sooooo love my sleek little sopt!\n",
      "no problem\n",
      "works as described.  a+++++\n",
      "best streaming device i've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the roku remote does.\n",
      "loved them\n",
      "i've had an alexa dot for some time but i'm really enjoying the alexa show. it's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. played jeapordy, but i'm not good at it. you do learn trivia and no one's watching! love that recipes are visible and movies are available. haven't had it long enough to try everything.\n",
      "cool\n",
      "i do like the fire stick and i’m very close to cutting the cable.  i can find many movies and shows, while keeping my budget in check.  i’m learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly.\n",
      "love alexa!!  i own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!\n",
      "love this! so many options!\n",
      "love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . just as good as bose speakers around house -\n",
      "so far i like it.  i bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.\n",
      "the best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. well done.\n",
      "she doesn’t always listen\n",
      "love it...just like the other 4 i own.\n",
      "just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.\n",
      "works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.\n",
      "i use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information\n",
      "it's annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. you spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\n",
      "bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones i bought prior! came in original packaging as well!\n",
      "we love alexa! we use her to play music, play radio through itunes, play podcasts through anypod, and set reminders. we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. we rely on our custom lists. we like being able to voice control the volume. we're sure we'll continue to find new uses.sometimes it's a bit frustrating when alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\n",
      "love it...just like the other 4 i own.\n",
      "i have been wanting one of these for a while now.  bought on prime day and absolutely love it.\n",
      "love love love these. the only think i notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots (we have 4 echo products throughout our house). i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. i'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!\n",
      "easy to set up and works like it's supposed to.\n",
      "this is pretty cool\n",
      "love my amazon products\n",
      "i love my amazon sticks\n",
      "love listening to music. still trying to learn everything it does.\n",
      "the problem i have with this item could just be my inexperience. i ordered the wrong thing, but then decided i’d set it up and use alexa. i was trying to replace a small bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. thought i could learn as i go. i downloaded the app, but never could get the echo to sync with my iphone. i’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.\n",
      "mainly use it for the music but i’m learning more all the time.  really nothing bad to say about it\n",
      "this is my first alexa device and it is so fun to discover all of the ways to use it. the biggest con with me is the \"drop-in\" feature, it's pretty creepy\n",
      "a great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the view or gen2. it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.\n",
      "i have had for only a week, so i am still learning all that alexa can do.  it is a learning process.  i love the music i can call up any time.  i listen to podcasts and radio stations.  i have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which i love.  i don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  the sound is good.  i am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the echo is fine for me.  this afternoon i am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  going to surprise him.\n",
      "love our little dot. i don’t know what the original larger alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.\n",
      "works well. need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.\n",
      "i love my new echo.  it gives me hours of music and help with other things.it was difficult for me to set it up,  i had to have help from a tekkie\n",
      "i have the google home that i really like. the echo plus i think has even a better sound and am totally happy with it.\n",
      "so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app\n",
      "sad joke. worthless.\n",
      "ideal when you have amazon prime.. my very first fire tv stick... i should have purchased one a long time ago.... i wish i bought 2 or 3 on amazon prime day..... and not to forget the fantastic alexa features..\n",
      "\n",
      "love it!  works perfectly!\n",
      "i am impressed with the sound quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "this product is a complete waste of money. when you ask alexa a question \"she\" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of wikipedia!\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "love it!  so do the grandkids!!\n",
      "up dated news\n",
      "love my echo show! great sound and picture. does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!\n",
      "some times alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!\n",
      "love the firestick! my kids love that they can talk to alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.\n",
      "for the size of the screen this thing should be $25\n",
      "these are great. i bought one and then bought another right away. grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. highly recommended.\n",
      "excellent product !!\n",
      "i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i'm not really tech savvy. i found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! i'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!\n",
      "love it\n",
      "the only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  a massive difference from the alexa.  which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.\n",
      "a great device\n",
      "works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.\n",
      "the echo spot is really great. i just got it and is easy to set up. i do have one problem. when the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. the home screen is just the time😔. i spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. i am disappointed because i wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. i am hoping they will do something about this. other than that it’s great\n",
      "we love this thing! i wish i would have gotten it sooner. you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. there are loads of skills. i am very happy with this purchase, especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price.\n",

      "i am huge amazon fan! first to have a kindle and the echo. i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. i do love it!! my kids love it! they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can’t. it’s spot to spot. can’t even skype (which i do often with my aunt). the is my major disappointment with it.\n",

      "i'm loving my easy access to all the music and books i listen to from amazon music and audible.  the treble, mid and bass sound well-equalized.  i love that i can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in.  it's nice and light weight, with a good length of cord.\n",

      "exchange new color\n",
      "good wifi tv stick\n",
      "i don't know why i like it, but i do. it's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  if you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  if you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  it shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  it's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  it also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  the viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.\n",
      "was excited to try this on my new element tv.  unfortunately even though my tv is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  it didn’t!\n",
      "alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on iheart radio or spotify i want. plus when i do get smart home devices she’ll be even more useful to me! she’s really helpful with answering random questions. the small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures.\n",

      "works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. i love being able to not only hear, but now see, what i need on this device. i loved my regular echo, but the show is just so much better!  it works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. love it!\n",
      "got a good deal and works great with prime.  setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.\n",

      "works great ..good sound\n",
      "i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. i don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. it was also very difficult to set up. the directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. i was almost ready to send to back.the app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think it's an ok item.\n",

      "i love every aspect of the echo plus, i wanted it for my office. the light was also for my desk lamp.\n",
      "i would not recommend this to anyone. it won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. it tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. try again later.  it is not the netflix site cause i can stream it just fine on my computer.  its the firestick. very disappointing.\n",
      "works and sounds great! my house is barely 1100sf, and i have this sitting on my kitchen counter. i can hear it, and speak to it from any room. lots of functionality still to discover.\n",
      "the sound of the speaker is better than the other echo i own!\n",

      "we love having this in our kitchen! very convenient to look up recipes, listen to the news, or watch prime video while i'm cooking\n",
      "saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.\n",

      "so far so good.\n",
      "gift for husband.  great!\n",
      "echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website. since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready.  unfortunately that is not case.  perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated.\n",
      "such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. no need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. the speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. the price is right for a device like this.\n",
      "i loved the i can use voice to make a request. i use it for music and movies.\n",
      "i love this thing! the alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it.  no more searching netflix then amazon etc to see if either has your show,  alexa finds it for you!\n",
      "4 out of 5 stars. i have the original tall echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 show.  the only thing i'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the spot. when using drop in.  sometimes i'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  the voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. the optical is fine........ it's just the sound. sometimes i'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and i'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  i find the echo dot, original echo and the show has much better sound quality.  that's one reason i bought the echo show.\n",
      "\n",
      "i own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  you can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, things to try...  people will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  that would give you a 5 star device.right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  my wife says we should.\n",

      "it's fun to imagine the household management options ...some info questions baffle alexa, but other options are cool - esp. music-related ...\n",
      "setting up\n",
      "love my fire stick and remote, so easy to set up and use. endless amounts of apps to download! used it with my smart tv and it’s 100x better than the features smart tvs offer\n",
      "excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns\n",
      "really cool device that does a ton of stuff. fun games like jeopardy. we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.\n",
      "alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked. for example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money\n",
      "i do love these things, i have them running my entire home, tv, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... i named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.\n",
      "pleased with the order just what i wanted!!\n",
      "simple set up.  music everywhere.\n",
      "initially, this echo dot worked very well. over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. the other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. would not recommend buying refurbished.\n",
      "the alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. it could definitely be louder.\n",
      "it works ok. this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x. i would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.\n",
      "works absolutely great\n",
      "i really like it .\n",
      "nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than i expected\n",
      "i received my echo dot today in good condition, but be advised: i paid $29.99 for it and amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!set up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings. i called amazon customer service, and i dunno what it is, but lately i’ve been getting terrible support. the guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.i’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong. reconnecting is a pain each time as well.all that said, when alexa works, she works amazingly well. i don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “hey siri” feature is all but useless. alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. i haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so i’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your led devices (eg. rainbow effects), alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.all in all, my rating would’ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item. if the connectivity problems persist, i may have to exchange/return this item. i don’t want to though — alexa’s kind of growing on me.\n",
      "good as new!! just like brand new! save yourself some money. get one!\n",
      "i like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.\n",
      "i didn't like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.\n",
      "good quality, great sound quality\n",
      "good\n",
      "easy to use.\n",
      "music, weather, time.\n",

      "we use alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather. we are still learning other ways to use her. everything has been ready and hands free so far. the speaker has great volume and sound!\n",
      "gave as a gift - they loved it.\n",
      "have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great\n",
      "very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\n",
      "still learning all the ways to use it.  it is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  very cute.\n",
      "i love it!  i especially love that it is so small and does so much.  got rid of my old cd/alarm clock radio.  much more room on nightstand.\n",
      "a great product for the price, works well!!\n",
      "it has replaced my clock and google mini on my nightstand.  outstanding little device.  i hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock.\n",
      "alexa is amazing! great speaker.\n",
      "i love it best gift i got myself\n",
      "listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\n",
      "has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.\n",
      "this is my second echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen. i can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.\n",
      "works and sounds great.\n",
      "this is a gift.  but i have one and love it.  the words to songs are great and the i live the face i chose for the clock.  this is my favorite echo (unless i am listening to music).\n",
      "got this as a gift and love it. i never would have bought one for myself, but now that i have it.... allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.\n",
      "the speaker is of surprising quality. happy with the purchase.\n",
      "i like everything about it !!!\n",
      "no you tube wouldn't have bought it if i known that\n",
      "nice add on to a home.what i don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. it won't give you much info of sport teams other than american.\n",
      "this is the one of my favorite amazon devices.  have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. perfect addition to our home of alexa devices.\n",
      "alarm, calendar, reminders\n",
      "i love my echo spot!\n",
      "just got my third one. love them\n",

      "alexa is phenomenal!\n",
      "i received the echo as a gift. i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. can’t wait to see what else it can do.\n",

      "nice\n",
      "enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  ran into one frustrating issue.  it was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.\n",
      "this is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  it doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having alexa repeat “ok alarm set for 5am.”  not good.  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  no thanks, if i’m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i’m in the shower.\n",
      "use the product for music and it’s great!\n",
      "love this!  have it in the kitchen and works well!\n",
      "very easy to set up and have no issues.\n",
      "it has a nice speaker.\n",
      "the ease in installing\n",
      "love!! i still haven't figured out all the best things we can do with it.\n",
      "this is very user friendly\n",
      "weak sound. compared to the google home mini the sound is bad. also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. i think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\n",
      "i love it.  i made a group with my echo dot so i get music through my home.  i am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully i can get another spot for my bedroom..  i love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..\n",
      "sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have echo and dots).  picture quality is good\n",
      "fun tech toy\n",
      "i like to watch older shows, 70's and 80's, and the firestick gives me the opportunity to find those shows.\n",
      "my new bff!\n",
      "we like it. very convenient\n",
      "i love being able to control lights, doors and music.\n",
      "we're thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo. installation was easy using the alexa app. i purchased 2 kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. installation again was easy using the kasa app. they sinqued right up with the echo. we're enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome. we've added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. setup was seamless. we're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.\n",
      "we just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! my son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. we all enjoy this one so much that i just bought a second one this week during prime deals day!\n",
      "there's really no dislike for alexa( dot) i thought cortna was cool but alexa is an awesome application to the family. unbelievable device which seems alive. a must get.\n",
      "this thing is a lot cooler than i thought it would be.  i mostly have used it to read me audiobooks, but i also love that i can see into the camera while i'm at work.\n",
      "love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.\n",
      "i don’t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of “inactivity”. i shouldn’t have to “wake up” the fire tv to finish watching a show.\n",
      "i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\n",
      "second dot.\n",
      "love these.  great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  or listen to cnn live with serius sm.\n",
      "great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc.\n",
      "i love the idea is the star trek computer at home. the skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.\n",
      "i like the weather options but alexa search compacity needs improvement. she aint no google. alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. currently alexa doesn't do youtube either. this is a huge drawback and why the echo show dropped in price.  international radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.\n",
      "was loving it but starting in june hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn’t work either. probably will switch to something else soon.\n",
      "after two weeks i am not sure if i like the ever present alexa to have a screen as well.  i bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  there is something about only audio that made alexa different, no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to.\n",
      "i loved talking it out of the box and being able to easily set up.\n",
      "i absolutely love this!!!  i have it in my kitchen so i can use it for cooking. the speakers are amazing!!!\n",
      "good product\n",
      "just like the other one\n",
      "weak sound. compared to the google home mini the sound is bad. also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. i think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\n",
      "awesome device to have in home.  full of very useful information.  don't have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions.\n",
      "works fine!!\n",
      "i love these, i have 2 dots and one echo. for a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although i do use external for the dots.\n",
      "although i haven't taken advantage of many of the echo's features there is one that bothers me. it starts talking even when i haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - echo - had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device.\n",
      "i like it alot. i connected it so i can play my pandora and i asked about the weather & time every morning. i got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because i can have my music play unlimited on this. i'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once i get more comfortable with it. definitely worth the money.\n",
      "perfect for streaming our shows. ditched cable and we are in love!\n",
      "i like to use it for listening to podcasts.  i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  the one thing i don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to.  i finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\n",
      "it has great sound and very responsive to commands!\n",
      "the ase of participating with echo\n",
      "i love this thing. i talk to it through walls and in other rooms. i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so i was ready for this when it came out. the screen is just so nice to have.the only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song i want to hear, but i do have a deep southern accent, lower alabama, so i don't speak english anyways.\n",
      "the speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. besides that naw\n",
      "it plays music that i request.\n",
      "needs to play youtube and prime video and maybe netflix. but it has good sound\n",
      "super easy to hook up and program. i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time. it’s great for my news updates too!\n",
      "the speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!\n",
      "i have had all good experience, so far with the second generation echo. there are so many more things to learn, but i have not had the time yet. right now, i am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. i am very excited to begin using them\n",
      "i'm amazed at how many movies, tv shows and more is available. i am planning to drop cable service soon and am very happy to know i'll have lots of viewing pleasure with the fire stick and not pay the outrageous cable bills.\n",
      "very easy setup.\n",
      "fire hd does so much more.  over priced pair of speakers.\n",
      "initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.\n",
      "alexa is phenomenal!\n",
      "absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  when playing  music with  bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs.\n",
      "works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  audio quality is okay for the size.\n",
      "love the music the stories\n",
      "works like a champ.\n",
      "absolutely love it!!!!\n",
      "i love having an alexa!\n",
      "love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "works great.. nice sound and picture\n",
      "we love this.\n",
      "haven't used it enough\n",
      "the speaker could be better...\n",
      "great sound from a little speaker\n",
      "with the combination of this, smart plugins, and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it. i can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!\n",
      "it does so much more than i knew when i bought it. it pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment\n",
      "very good quality and you don’t have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly\n",
      "prime day pricing was good, but the show is very limited.  no video services available except amazon video.  no netflix or youtube.  alexa is very limited also, not nearly as useful as google.\n",
      "bought my first echo dot and loved it so i got this for work. absolutely love it!\n",
      "not connected to my phone playlist :(\n",
      "never could get it to work. a techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. so, i am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "works good. however, the price went down the week after i purchased it.\n",
      "it's so efficient and amazing!  how cool!  we all use it often every day...\n",
      "loved the price for an essentially brand new dot!! opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. everything looked brand new. for $20 less than a new unit, i couldn’t consider this a better deal! i really love the versatility of the echo dot. get you one while you can!\n",
      "love it\n",
      "very easy to set up and straight forward directions. loads fast also.\n",
      "works beautifully, excellent sound.\n",
      "love my dots.  easy to use.  i have two plus the echo spot.  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... amazon, iheart radio, pandora.\n",
      "amazon fire stick is amazing !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "it's like having your tv as a big tablet\n",
      "highly like my eco show.no complaints\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.\n",
      "love it! easy setup and i can ‘drop in’ on my daughter and son-in-law who live in st. louis anytime. everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right 😎\n",
      "excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!\n",
      "it was perfect.  works like a charm.\n",
      "music\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am not very specific about the title.\n",
      "the sound is fantastic for the classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;alexa volume 3&#34;\n",
      "i like being able to watch pretty much anything i want at anytime. works great!\n",
      "sound is better\n",
      "i have had all good experience, so far with the second generation echo. there are so many more things to learn, but i have not had the time yet. right now, i am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. i am very excited to begin using them\n",
      "it was much smaller than i was expecting for the cost.\n",
      "i love my echo plus. the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.\n",
      "bought the 2nd firestick for bedroom. easily installed and set up. works great\n",
      "purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\n",
      "\n",
      "you’re all i need...na na nana!\n",
      "love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. great to drop in on family around the house.\n",
      "it is very easy to use,i can now watch my favorite movies\n",
      "so far it seems to be a very nice item. it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. i've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\n",
      "we love it!!  we use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it!\n",
      "the fire tv stick was easy to set up and use. only downfall is, subscriptions are needed to view premium content.\n",
      "great price.  i love my echo dot,\n",
      "i didn’t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. i thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you singley plugged into your tv. however, since using my amazon fire stick i have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all.\n",
      "for a refurbished item.. it works like its new... which i love... easy set up,  which i love. the only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  i recommend  purchasing a speaker.\n",
      "i owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since english is her second language she was born in korea. but the sound from the echo is superb. so we’ll keep it..\n",
      "pretty cool. i have only begun to figure out things she does.\n",
      "i received the echo as a gift. i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. can’t wait to see what else it can do.\n",
      "alexa is fun! i’ve added smart home aspects, my friend listens to spotify, my husband enjoys interacting too.\n",
      "love the dot\n",
      "love it!! don’t know what took me so long to get one — and don’t know why i didn’t get two on amazon prime day!\n",
      "very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\n",
      "netflix and hulu\n",
      "very good option\n",
      "easy to set-up!  i am enjoying the added video choices for my television.\n",
      "i think the dot listens better than spot.\n",
      "like new\n",
      "well what can you say,  love it  love it  love it  enough said\n",
      "i love it, it is just what i thought it would be!!!  i'm addicted!\n",
      "i can't get multiple profiles working. it just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt\n",
      "perfect. could not tell the difference from a new one.\n",
      "love my echo. love playing music in my room\n",
      "love it! bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. she is entertained for hours! good buy in my honest opinion!\n",
      "i’m very unhappy with this firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. we have 2 roku’s that work just fine and are very quick.\n",
      "easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot.\n",
      "currently own 3 chromecast devices and tge fire stick is superior to them.  we are so pleased that we can watch programs on netflix and prime without a smart phone or computer.  very easy to install and use!\n",
      "we are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.\n",
      "love it! it's everything i wanted and more\n",
      "i wish it did more with internet searches.  i do like the feature it has\n",
      "thanks\n",
      "i love the product , but very disappointed once i  realized i can no longer play youtube videos.  i'm now past my 30 days return date.  i am realizing i now have an expensive alarm clock.  i am hoping youtube comes back.  i was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. glad i didn't.\n",
      "this device works perfectly and was a good price.  we love alexa and are having great fun with her.  the music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  i didn’t think i would enjoy having ai in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy.\n",
      "i like to use it for listening to podcasts.  i like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  the one thing i don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station i wanted to listen to.  i finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\n",
      "bought this for my son and he loves it.\n",
      "i love it.\n",
      "nope. still a lot to be improved. for most of the things we ask.. it says.. hmmmm.. i dont know that.\n",
      "i bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. if they weren't labeled as refurbished i wouldn't have known\n",
      "this is our first alexa.... we love it!!\n",
      "wonderful, still learning how to use. had a heck of a time setting it up, but is happened somehow.\n",
      "works great i love it, grand daughter digs the watching of cartoons on it lol\n",
      "plays great\n",
      "handy as hell 10/10 recommend\n",
      "great device, i'm cutting my cable and watching the channels i want. if i want to add an app like cbs i can just pay a little extra and get it.\n",
      "already owning a couple of echos, i was frustrated that i couldn’t also use them as intercoms. finally amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now i can use my echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).as for its other features, we mainly use our echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. it's not the life-changing home device amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. this refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\n",
      "love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.\n",
      "love it... can't stop using it..\n",
      "cool little speaker..i love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!\n",
      "love it , now if i can only find the correct smart (links)plug to connect this too\n",
      "never had any issue with buying use electronics as long as i get the good or like new. just read the comment to see why it is used.\n",
      "works great! killer speaker! my wife and son love it.\n",
      "i got it to try side by side with the echo originale. they are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. as many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue, z wave or anything else. it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. for me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i don't really need the hub with less functionality. in addition, i don't think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs. net net for me, this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good. with the  original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\n",
      "meh\n",
      "the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature.  you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo. easy to use\n",
      "we really love our echo dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.\n",
      "is good.\n",
      "gift for my man. he doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. would prefer it cordless. still works though for the purpose we bought it.\n",
      "works great just like the new one that i already had.\n",
      "easy installation and set up. better sound from the echo dot smart speaker. very satisified with purchase.\n",
      "did t really know what i could use this device for. used it for a few things, but need an overview\n",
      "i am not super impressed with alexa. when my prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. she isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. just today i unplugged her...not sure i'll ever use my alexa again.\n",
      "works with blink video cameras.  does not work with you tube.\n",
      "i use this product for enjoyment and i just love it\n",
      "love this product!!\n",
      "it's easy to set up and use. there are new features and skills added all the time.\n",
      "so far pretty happy with the spot. for me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh, i like it. i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. so far so good.\n",
      "in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. would love to have a voice personalization. some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. so far only positive experience. the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.\n",
      "works perfectly\n",
      "worked as advertised !\n",
      "love alexa. love the echo dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.\n",
      "bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.\n",
      "doubtful at first, but it works a lot better than my smart devices.plus alexa software include, that was a plus!\n",
      "what can i say. well, i’m a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. so yes i love my echo stuff but, i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. be carful with these people!  entering your wi-fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no third-party app, amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\n",
      "it's a fun item to have.  has a lot of udefulness.  big negative is that it doesn't use google (or any real search engine) to get answers or find information.\n",
      "as always, easy to set up\n",
      "i own 5 echo devices, consider me addicted! this little number is awesome, not only do i like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices. one feature i really like is how it slowly dims after i turn off my bedroom light, so i have a night light for a bit. i love echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!\n",
      "really like it\n",
      "awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. great purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better. i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo. i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. oh well it is what it is and i still love it. i'm just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.\n",
      "yet another exho for our home and love them all!!!\n",
      "great!\n",
      "i love that i can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. not sure how i survived with out this for so long.\n",
      "so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity\n",
      "after we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with echo plus\n",
      "i love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself\n",
      "i was contacted by people in india. were they suppose to charge me $79.00? it was very hard to understand their instructions. they did have control of my computer and network. i, also, bought a cloud cam but do not know how to make it work with alexa.\n",
      "very easy set up. really enjoying it\n",
      "speaker is better than 1st generation echo\n",
      "3rd dot. love it!\n",
      "still learning everything she can do.  good for a room.  volume is pretty good without an additional speaker\n",
      "\n",
      "love it , now if i can only find the correct smart (links)plug to connect this too\n",
      "upgraded from an original echo on prime day and so far i love it. i'm sure i have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now i owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. who knew post malone actually used words?!\n",
      "alexa is pretty dumb ,,,\n",
      "love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps\n",
      "the echo is an amazing device.  many times it seems very intuitive.  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  installation was fairly straightforward, but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out.  my advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms (which i am told can be done).  however, i can't make any of the echos aware of the others existence.  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  i know this is likely my fault, but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  a small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\n",
      "i really like this item. i already had the echo dot but with this purchase the philips hue bulb came with the plus. just purchasing the plus i have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. i use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and i really like it. the plus is in our great room/kitchen area. so far i give this a 5 star.\n",
      "as a user of chromecast for years i have to say that the firestick is a nice upgrade. i really like that i can download all the apps for different media sources like hbo, showtime, etc. that i have free access to from my cable account but with the firestick i get a better picture and can go directly to the shows i want to see. the downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up, but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure.\n",
      "tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. you still need some work on the ai, in responding to random questions though. my android phone is far better at those... with the echo i still get a lot of &#34;hmm, i'm not sure&#34; or &#34;i don't have an opinion on that.&#34;\n",
      "i connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my google home mini can't do.  it works well.\n",
      "big step up from the dot! dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up ring pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.\n",
      "our family really loves this new echo\n",
      "works well, pictures awesome! sound could be better. must be on the same bandwidth as other alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.\n",
      "no problems\n",
      "great technology!! can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. wish i had bought another one!\n",
      "i love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when i ask.\n",
      "too difficult to set up.  it keeps timing out before you can enter the password\n",
      "doesn't always respond to the wake word. this is my 3rd echo product and i have to say i am a little disappointed. alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.\n",
      "don't waste your money.  i own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. they all do a far better job of voice recognition that the echo show.  in fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  i've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  i can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(using facetime is so much more practicalthan using the show.) i'm surprised amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.\n",
      "i love it! super easy to use. hole the button and speak....takes you right to it without delay :-)\n",
      "awesome. i love alexa.\n",
      "love, love this new little gadget.  has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  we hardly need our cd's anymore, since alexa plays everything we need.  going to get the alexa dots soon for more rooms.  thanks!!\n",
      "this is my first alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!\n",
      "i have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. it was even easier to set up than my original echo.\n",
      "good smart home gadget.\n",
      "blue light blinks all the time\n",
      "good but it’s pretty low\n",
      "i’ve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and i absolutely love it! it’s so easy to use. i’m basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. the screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. i don’t know how i lived without it so long. if you can’t decide whether to buy it or not, go for it! you won’t regret it!!\n",
      "easy to set-up and to use.\n",
      "this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.\n",
      "amazing product\n",
      "great\n",
      "love it. works great making my home a smarthome\n",
      "worked as advertised. thanks\n",
      "very pleasedsimple to figure out\n",
      "i like how small it is, but i’m still able to see my ring cameras.\n",
      "perfect! may favorite alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  we changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. good job amazon!\n",
      "wonderful product and fast delivery!\n",
      "i bought this for my healing room.  i play continuous spa like music. although alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  i didn't know i had to buy speakers too.\n",
      "love it, love it!!!!!!!!\n",
      "like it. still working discovery. really too soon to fully evaluate. but looking forward to learning and using it.\n",
      "i love this technology. i'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room.\n",
      "extremely easy to use! switched away from directv and use it to stream t.v.\n",
      "very cool product. speaker sounds good with my spotify blasting through it.\n",
      "so easy to use, non-stop music!\n",
      "good size screen and gets good range for voice commands. sometimes it picks up weird commands when i'm watching tv though. great product for the price if you don't need the big show screen.\n",
      "love it! i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, i could not pass it up! it's fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music. you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker. i've been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\n",
      "works as advertised\n",
      "this is so much fun to play with - i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of - alexa learns from the questions i ask. she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it. when i want the current weather she tells me. ask her what going on in the city she knows. call a friend she will dial ( i haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\n",
      "i will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. with my lifetime amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, i’m sure i’m just a small customer to them, but i’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of amazon purchases.i have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this echo plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. the voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. most often it does nothing. i could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the amazon/zigbee ecosystem. if you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere\n",
      "great easy to set up.a little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent\n",
      "great item.  i'm so glad i made the purchase and on prime day.\n",
      "excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atención la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a través de la utilización con alexa. me sorprendió gratamente. muy recomendable.\n",
      "i didn't like that almost everytime i asked alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.\n",
      "i’m amazed\n",
      "only problem is my slow internet. i really like the speaker on it. having tons of fun with it\n",
      "i love it. it does everything\n",
      "nice works great\n",
      "i have it in the kitchen. great for news or music in the a.m. i can video call my daughter and grand kids. i really dig it!\n",
      "nice product a+\n",
      "i already had purchased the echo and a couple of dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  i am very glad i did.  the versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  no regrets!\n",
      "my 3rd echo device. very easy to set up. works perfectly.\n",
      "it looked brand nrw!! i have nothing to.complain about!! i will defently be ordering more\n",
      "love it as i do all of my echos\n",
      "this is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. why only 4 stars? supposed to work with logitech harmony remote: nope. supposed to work with denon av receivers: nope. this may not be amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. we also have the echo show, and the ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.\n",
      "cool little speaker..i love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!\n",
      "the way the music sounds is poor quality\n",
      "i love my echo plus. i haven't one bad thing to say. it controller music when i need it too. with a great sounding 360 speaker. i also bought a 4k fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment. the included hue lighting makes this product even better. i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. alexa will controll it all as soon as you say \"hey alexa\". and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "we love our echo spots. we now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. we do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.\n",
      "a small problem out of the box, but a rep from amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. i was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. i have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more i use it, and learn about it, the more i like it (them). i also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)i think gf is worried that if alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...\n",
      "i am very pleased with the echo show! i love that it has so many nice features. i highly recommend it.\n",
      "easy set up very user friendly\n",
      "this product is beautifully designed and i no longer have to hide an echo device away like i did with dot. it would be nice if amazon would lose that camera though, which i have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious.\n",
      "love it.  it works great.  alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  i'm not an expert but i think the sound quality is fine.  not perfect but good.\n",
      "great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  wow -- family fun and homework help.  talking with other grandchildren,who also have an echo, is a huge bonus.  can't wait to learn more and more and more\n",
      "absolutely love it\n",
      "great product but returning for new alexa dot.  refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.\n",
      "it was easy to set up and affordable! love it!\n",
      "best streaming device on the market. i now own 3.\n",
      "worked like new.  will do it again.\n",
      "echo show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. no need to print them. wonderful device. acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.\n",
      "love the dot\n",
      "works well. just disappointed with the speaker quality. but hooked it up to old computer speakers.\n",
      "we have only been using alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. it like having a new household member! we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\n",
      "just got mine last night. played around with it for a while. should have bought it a long time ago.\n",
      "so far so good.  neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses. nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to.  flash briefings have good videos.  speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "love echo, everywhere i go in my house she's always reminding me, playing music or talking to me.  love her.\n",
      "got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative\n",
      "easy to set up and use. too bad it has to be plugged in. would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.\n",
      "so far it has worked well. not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or \"skills\", but getting the hang of it.\n",
      "i like that it’s voice activated but it don’t link with any other bluetooth devices only alexa devices\n",
      "i'm obsessed with alexa. she tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you????\n",
      "loved it.\n",
      "just like it's big sister, the echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)used in another room to add alexa to an additional room.\n",
      "works as advertised. very easy to setup. still learning what this can do.\n",
      "i bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  i understand the frustration of not having youtube though.  still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  lol  all in all- a great product with good speakers.\n",
      "for as awesome as the echo and echo dots are, the spot is a disappointment. there is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. at this point if i hadn't thrown the box away immediately, i would have sent it back and just got another full size echo.\n",
      "we're thoroughly enjoying our amazon echo. installation was easy using the alexa app. i purchased 2 kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. installation again was easy using the kasa app. they sinqued right up with the echo. we're enjoying playing music with the echo and the sound quality is awesome. we've added a kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. setup was seamless. we're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. looking forward to exploring other options with this device.\n",
      "i love the fact, that i can unplug it, and take it to my basement when i want do laundry.\n",
      "love the product. nice to have easy access to so much info!!!\n",
      "i am in love with alexa\n",
      "a great device\n",
      "working great and my daughter loves it!\n",
      "very easy to set up and have no issues.\n",
      "did take me about 6 hours to set it up i have a galaxy s9 phone when i got used to the system setup it was in seconds edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy\n",
      "works perfect. save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. looks brand new.\n",
      "perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.\n",
      "\n",
      "fast shipping and works well\n",
      "this is a fun toy.  my daughter have me it.  it reads to me!\n",
      "great entertainment\n",
      "omg we love it!\n",
      "this is my first digital assistant so i'm giving this a good review. speaker is really good for the cheap price on prime day. fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (that's what i was going to get in the first place, but i ended up with echo). if you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!what i like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. my purchase came with a smart plug for $10 which i connect my lamp to. alexa, turn of the lights!\n",
      "i like everything about it !!!\n",
      "this makes a big difference in searching for programs, so much easier then the older fire stick, faster to.\n",
      "it every ting i thought it would be plus more.  this will be going to my mom right after i get through playing with it.\n",
      "this was purchased for our toy hauler, but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane.  it was wonderful to plug into our hotel tv and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials.\n",
      "great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi\n",
      "fun to work with still learning everything she can do\n",
      "very good quality\n",
      "works great, speed is fast. exactly what we needed\n",
      "there's room for improvement on this. for the price, i cannot complain too much. i can still complain however, the audio is terrible. this is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s.\n",
      "yes it met my expectations.  the snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  but without my glasses i can't read it and often it just snoozes.  then one day i must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  i have it set for mon-thu.  fri i don't need to get up early.  a more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  my old alarm had a red light.\n",
      "love this thing.. best toy i've bought myself in awhile.. so far i have a smart plug connected running my ac.  and the wifi light bulbs.  baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature.\n",
      "the echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.\n",
      "love!\n",
      "i love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great\n",
      "great sound\n",
      "great product\n",
      "the price is great.  was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  will buy some more. want 1 in every room.\n",
      "i love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.\n",
      "it’s a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up\n",
      "so far it has worked well. not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or \"skills\", but getting the hang of it.\n",
      "great product we listen to music all the time\n",
      "fairly easy to use\n",
      "just got my third one. love them\n",
      "love this\n",
      "\n",
      "works great to control the tv lights and various other devices. lately i've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. just shout out &#34;alexa, what time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. the echo plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a great device. we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to red alert or make the tardis land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;computer&#34; instead of &#34;alexa&#34;. now we just need majel barret's voice and i will be in geek heaven.) ;)it's not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. i am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. we also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. plus it's fun knowing the nsa is listening to everything.\n",
      "love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered\n",
      "like it to do more\n",
      "it's not as good as siri, but it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. i personally felt that i paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after i purchased it). so i'm pretty disappointed. i might still return it and get my money back. .\n",
      "amazing product\n",
      "we love it! bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!\n",
      "works like a charm. fast delivery and no problems.\n",
      "she's [alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way i phrase things with my ny/nj regional accent.\n",
      "i received an echo as a gift, loved it so much i decided to get the dot for my bedroom. both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. i would still buy it again.\n",
      "nice product a+\n",
      "it talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when i ask if to.\n",
      "still leaning about it. the price was right!\n",
      "i love my echo dot! looks brand new and works perfect! very satisfied.\n",
      "unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to amazon.\n",
      "everything\n",
      "it does everything  the big guy does\n",
      "i love it.\n",
      "i got this for dad on father's day!  he was tickled with it!\n",
      "very easy to install.  very intuitive to use.  very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "works great i bought this direct from amazon, and i have got to tell you, this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek. i am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. thank god, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. thank you amazon. i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on ssdi thank you all again.\n",
      "works better than anticipated. this thing is awesome.\n",
      "love the product. nice to have easy access to so much info!!!\n",
      "still learning about the echo show but so far we love it. my 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together.\n",
      "i loved it does exactly what it says\n",
      "i like the compact structure of the dot. the sound is a little too low.\n",
      "i’m impressed with the quality of sound that the echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my bose mini. i only gave 4 stars because i can’t use my apple music account.\n",
      "the echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;things to try&#34;. i am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. i found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. if i cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.\n",
      "i love all that you can do with the echo spot!\n",
      "i returnef this item because it does not speak spanish\n",
      "works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.\n",
      "i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  i think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  i also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\n",
      "not substitute for the original.  the echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  to listen it has to be at the highest level 10.\n",
      "this is our 5th amazon echo device.  we have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  you can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  our echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more.\n",
      "i love this device. i upgraded from the echo spot. i just wish i could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what i was used to in the echo spot. also, there is better sound quality on this device.\n",
      "still learning to use these things.  they sure are smart!  haha  she started reading a book to me yesterday.  get one.  i like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.\n",
      "it was an excellent purchase. echo plus has sound quality, good size, i love it... i it!\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "no youtube\n",
      "i wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  the speech recognition software is horrible.  my wife and i both are native americans whose language is english she is from the north i am from texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  we bought two they do the same thing.  additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. i had to buy wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  both had problems switched them around no difference.  so it they are now disconnected dust collectors.\n",
      "it was perfect\n",
      "device was not working. followed all instructions for alexa echo dot and it did not come on. very upsetting.\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "have only had it set up for a few days. still adding smart home devices to it. the speaker is great for playing music. i like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.\n",
      "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n",
      "very intrusive, so i turn it off\n",
      "works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!\n",
      "how can you not like the echo plus.  it has the built in hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  amazon makes a great product and i haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).\n",
      "very intelligent, love the songs ....\n",
      "i like echo spot. i bought it to use as an alarm clock. one negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better\n",
      "great for my office. i use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music.\n",
      "works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!\n",
      "i loved everything about this item. quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house.\n",
      "overall i like this. though siri on my phone can do more for what i need as i don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. but it’s fun and i use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.\n",
      "good price. prompt shipping. has been working flawlessly.\n",
      "we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  you can even hear music played. the speaker is clear.  we are enjoying it.  what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  the next day, i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  it was a little disconcerting.\n",
      "purchased this on prime day and i absolutely love it!  i had the echo dot on my nightstand, but i really missed a display. this is perfect and the speakers are excellent.\n",
      "i like the echo, but not sure about the dot.  i use it a lot for music and audio books.the sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  i haven't decided if i'll keep it or not!\n",
      "love everything about this....\n",
      "i'm amazed with the alarm. i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  i love the play list if music. not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.\n",
      "totally gets out sense of humour\n",
      "given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  she loves it.\n",
      "set up is so easy.\n",
      "works great, never had any issues.\n",
      "i got a second unit for the bedroom, i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i didnt really see a difference at all.  overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\n",
      "without having a cellphone, i cannot use many of her features. i have an ipad but do not see that of any use.  it is a great alarm.  if u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.it is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\n",
      "good device\n",
      "i don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  but it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  but if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but i don't understand why i can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker.  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker.\n",
      "i got a second unit for the bedroom, i was expecting the sounds to be improved but i didnt really see a difference at all.  overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\n",
      "love it, love it!!!!!!!!\n",
      "so far not impressed at all. does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time i'm not sure what the excitement is all about. alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am i supposed to understand!!!!i'm going to return and try a google home!!!\n",
      "not impressed\n",
      "extremely low in volume\n",
      "works great\n",
      "i like that it responds every time. it was easy to set up.  i'm still learning what i can do with it. i may like a better speaker more.\n",
      "i basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should.\n",
      "it works great!!\n",
      "while i loved alexa....this is a whole new level. love it. fun to watch movie trailers. weather is so much more complete. when you listen to music....the lyrics appear. still discovering all echo show can do. highly recommend. takes alexa to a completely new world.\n",
      "it's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. its still hot or miss when it recognizes things\n",
      "phenomenal\n",
      "was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all\n",
      "works great.\n",

      "easy to install and operate. works with alexa voice commands.\n",
      "i liked the original echo. this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. i miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) other than that, well i do like the use of a standard usb charger /port instead of the previous round pin. other than that, i guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to alexa/echo/computer. so what's not to like? :)\n",
      "i love you so much\n",
      "this was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. he loves it, ask alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. so i purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when i’m getting ready for work. i listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. replacement for my clock radio, plus i have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..\n",
      "good speaker for bedroom or office\n",
      "i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues. after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot. however, the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and i haven't had any problems since. so, if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\n",
      "family loved it!\n",
      "like it alots, something different than traditional television. the use of alexa is nice too.\n",
      "everything\n",
      "awesome product, very responsive!alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. it uses the bing search engine instead of google. if only the two could combine. it would be a perfect product.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "works well, but the speaker is not so grand. getting another speaker to drop this into. in the future i would have just gone with the full size echo.\n",
      "what can i say. well, i’m a  paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. so yes i love my echo stuff but, i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. be carful with these people!  entering your wi-fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. try to stay with devices that  work directly with the alexa hub with no third-party app, amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\n",
      "this is my second one. i have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.it is amazing for a quick look up while i am working. i live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.i will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. the gift of organization and information at a voice command away.\n",
      "makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.\n",

      "seems to have trouble hearing me when i say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.\n",
      "the fact that she can help me find my phone when i am at home alone is worth the price of this device\n",
      "dislike the volume. it does not sound loud enough.\n",
      "i love it,she is very helpful. i use her for remembering things and sleep. you can ask her just about anything. i have only had her for about a week so still learning her.\n",
      "i love having alexa around the house. my favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. especially her library of sleep sounds. i got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. she is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.the only thing i really don't like, is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function. no ifs ands, or buts. i get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as i have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. lol\n",
      "i needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  i am a believer in amazon echo, alexa and fire.  great customization options and alexa is always helpful.  sound quality is also surprisingly good.\n",
      "great device.  seems to work better than the 1st generation!\n",
      "i love it. it plays my sleep sounds immediately when i ask\n",
      "love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!\n",
      "excellent. bought another one yesterday!\n",
      "easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  the sound quality while for listening to music on pandora is wonderful!!\n",
      "easy to set up and use. too bad it has to be plugged in. would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.\n",
      "very puny sound, but works great.\n",
      "i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot. alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions i have asked i get the &#34;i'm not sure&#34;  half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying &#34;i'm not sure&#34;. the music is great and works well for that. all in all so far it's been a very frustrating experience.\n",
      "the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home. i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google. but as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.\n",
      "i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa. i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc. to the commands from alexa. but, i really love having the music.\n",
      "am very happy now that i can see.\n",

      "so far so good\n",
      "the echo dot (2nd generation) smart speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. i also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. it works great with the alexa app. i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\n",
      "it works perfect!\n",

      "handy if you don't expect much out of it much \"dumber\" than the assistant in my phone.\n",

      "no problems, works as expected. could have a better speaker.\n",
      "i love the size of the echo spot. it fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. i like going to sleep with the lightening storm. the images along with the sounds are very relaxing. the calling and messaging feature is great. it’s small enough to take with when we travel. i love and own most of the alexa products. our whole family uses them.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "\n",
      "we got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once i did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so tech support can help setup the device ! i had to get a friend whos an it guy to come help me setup\n",
      "i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo. if you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a \"smart home\". the voice recognition is very impressive. it is stylish and fun. i have no regrets with this purchase. it is great for technically changes people. ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. if you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  if you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! you can even have conversations with the echo. i am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke. it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\n",
      "we love using it for bedtime reading on audible. it's very kid-friendly, and i can see liking it in the kitchen while i'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. we like it better than our echo dot.\n",

      "our family really loves this new echo\n",
      "the screen response time is way better than i expected. sound quality is good too, also it’s not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.\n",

      "the tech isn’t there. it doesn’t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio\n",
      "i’m a fan of echo devices. i think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock. i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. my two year old sleeps so much better with it on. we also use it to tell my two year old stories. only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night\n",
      "she works well. needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. alexa “learn” tasha’s birthday.  or alexa “learn” my definition of fine. etc. other than that she is great\n",

      "i love it\n",
      "i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough. the echo is the same except the sound quality, which i really didn't feel i needed. however, i am so glad i got it. what a difference! the sound really is far superior to the echo dot! now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power!\n",
      "bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! no more, &#34;philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message.\n",

      "would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;things to try&#34; screen!!!  i should have read up on this before buying the spot.  amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;things to try&#34;.\n",
      "part of it is my fault, i thought it could be wireless.  though for the price, i still feel like it should be. also the sound quality and volume could be better. i prefer the tap. unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or ipads. just not worth it.\n",
      "incredible piece of technology.i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. it's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo (2nd generation).the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought. i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all i had to do was say &#34;alexa, connect my devices&#34;. the default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34;, so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. in the alexa app, i created a 'group' with &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34; and named the group &#34;the light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say &#34;alexa, turn on the light&#34;.i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub. i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! i was surprised by that. awesome.you will feel like tony stark on this device. i added quite a few &#34;skills&#34; like 'thunderstorm sounds' and 'quote of the day' . alexa always loads them up quickly. adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature.i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.i was lucky to buy this for $100 on prime day, but i think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only $100. in my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) taller and 360 sound unit.2) volume knob on top that you spin (i think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) built in hub for hue bulbs. after researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. for me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now.\n",
      "when you think about it this really doesn’t do much. play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. i can see why price is dropping like a rock.\n",
      "the only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song .\n",
      "just getting use to using the echo. used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. working great so far.\n",
      "i returned 2 echo dots & am only getting refund for 1. i returned 2 in one package. i want my refunds for both of them. they are in the same package. can you not see them both???!!!\n",
      "i'm addicted to this thing.\n",
      "love this product i use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. the only thing i would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.\n",
      "this is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.\n",
      "fun just got it today now my i pod will go in my car and i will use this is the house.\n",

      "i love it.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth. the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device.\n",
      "i love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on amazon prime now during prime day and it was delivered same day for $99.\n",

      "i purchased the echo plus with the build-in hub, so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great!  i already had an echo dot in my kitchen/den area, so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom. my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tp-link plugs.  but, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus.  i am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  the echo dot requires a tp-link plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and  the echo plus with hub.  other than the high price of the bulbs, i love my echo plus with built in hub!\n",
      "why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with samsung tv's and many other devices?  i want my money back!  this thing won't even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub.  what's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  don't buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  it won't work with many of your devices.  just by the echo or dot if you must but not this.  better yet, get a google device.  they actually understand you when you talk.\n",
      "i'm loving my new echo show. the video screen adds so much more value and potential. movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the echo show. oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.\n",
      "i like how easy it was to set up. very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices.\n",
      "we are so glad that we got the echo over a bluetooth speaker. alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. i personally love the timer feature. it has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. pandora integration is another feature that i use daily. so happy with out prime day purchase. i will get the echo hub and a few more echo dots in the future.\n",
      "finally bought one but it couldn't find my wi-fi. had to buy a wi-fi extended. my smart t.v. used the wi-fi just fine.\n",

      "i was a little nervous when i received my new echo as i'm not really tech savvy. i found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! i'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!\n",
      "i like it\n",
      "i really love the hub feature\n",
      "love it\n",
      "used for personal use. we like hearing weather, news from cnn, and various playlists.\n",
      "great interface.  i enjoy the voice remote\n",
      "second dot.\n",
      "worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up sonos which was pretty easy. not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out.\n",
      "i already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it.  bought these new ones during the prime sale.\n",
      "the music...the shopping list and the sound....\n",
      "can’t change voice of echo\n",
      "purchased for grandson.\n",
      "very excited to see what it can do\n",
      "it does everything the echo does, and more. although i haven't and probably won't use the video functions. i had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. it does not and is very limited. i would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. it also always has a line that says &#34;tell alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. i would like to see that go away, but it won't. sound quality is good, not as good as the big echo, but good enough. i bought it on sale and think i got value for what i paid. i would have been disappointment had i of paid full price.\n",
      "thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. not much better than the echo dot. not worth the money.\n",
      "it's alright....\n",
      "not connected to my phone playlist :(\n",
      "echos are great i have a few of them through out our home .  all in voice range to ask a question. say a command to turn lights on or off. or my favorite is play music all though the house.\n",
      "purchased to use on the road in my semi. does not work in that application.\n",
      "love alexa these are the best thing i have ever bought don't know how i ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to\n",
      "this is my second firestick, i a very pleased with the ease of use.\n",
      "nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped.\n",
      "holy sound quality batman! this thing jams. it's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.\n",
      "speakers are not as loud as google home\n",
      "the speaker sounds really good\n",
      "this is great! got one for my gazebo and one upstairs.\n",
      "it don’t show nothing\n",
      "if you don't have an echo you definitely need one\n",
      "my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  i wish we knew all it's capabilities\n",
      "working great this far.  can't tell it's not new.  will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test.\n",
      "is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic\n",
      "great speaker with a lot of capabilities. very fun to learn how to use it.\n",
      "i didn’t order it\n",
      "echo dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.\n",
      "great product fast shipping\n",
      "this is my fourth echo (original and two dots). it's the best.... decent speaker... fun graphics...\n",
      "\n",
      "i love the echo spot!\n",
      "it seems to be ok but the instructions are weak and i can not seem to get it to work. i am going to get my techy friend to help me out and i will update you later\n",
      "sound is terrible. cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.\n",
      "good sometimes can’t hear well\n",
      "nice\n",
      "alarm and music, information the weather\n",
      "i love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.\n",
      "i love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! great for family game nights\n",
      "same specs as regular echo, but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights, etc.\n",
      "this one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.\n",
      "just like any other echo. doesn’t disappoint\n",
      "pleased with the echo, it is loud and can hear my voice and understand much better than previous versions.\n",
      "love it. so great to use!!!\n",
      "it,is,what it is and than some. sounds great too. on,y thing i dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  i asked echo show to show me camera and didn’t know what i was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can’t dhiw u what’s recording hmm\n",
      "its was easy to set up\n",
      "works absolutely great\n",
      "great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.\n",
      "it worked as a charmed.\n",
      "listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. there are many more task to learn. it was simple to set up.\n",
      "echo dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. i've unplugged it. it feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.\n",
      "good product i like it . thank you !\n",
      "we really only use this as a speaker to stream music. we’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.\n",
      "awesome!\n",
      "love my dots.  easy to use.  i have two plus the echo spot.  one of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... amazon, iheart radio, pandora.\n",
      "i love it!!!!!!\n",
      "perfect!  fast shipment and packaging.  worked as intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "love the firestick thinking about canceling the satellite\n",
      "this product is even better than i imagined. i love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  my family enjoys the games too! it’s made my life a little more easy! alexa is my personal assistant. :)\n",
      "i use the echo dot several different ways in my home. i use it downstairs to control lighting. i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker. it works great for what i need.\n",
      "love it!! great product!!!\n",
      "the echo works well. i was able to sync it with my other amazon music devices.\n",
      "echo is my teacher english, he is very funny,but sometimes he does not listen to what is said.\n",
      "i love this device. makes life easier the more you figure out it can do.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "fantastic product, i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program\n",
      "during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i couldn't resist! this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i couldn't be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"smart\" devices. thanks to her, i can control my lights, smart plugs, tv, etc. i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone. the app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! sound quality is good enough for me, since i am not an audiophile. alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. if you haven't yet, be sure to add alexa to your home!\n",
      "i love this device! all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen. it looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway. it’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. i’m planning to get another one for my guest room. awesome for a great price!\n",
      "i love it! i use it for everything. it’s a part of my daily routine\n",
      "easy to use, answers all my questions,hands free, what's not to like , it may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, i enjoy it totallly,, keeps your home connected\n",
      "love it , this time it's a gift  for friend\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "love these.  great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  or listen to cnn live with serius sm.\n",
      "disappointed that this device is not able to access youtube as of dec 2017. i wasn’t aware of that when i purchased it. i’ve had problems with my device. the voice stops working throughout the day. i can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info i asked about, but it’s like the device gets stuck in the process. it stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. i keep having to unplug and restart the device. once i do that, it starts working again. so irritating. this device could really be a great device if google and amazon would act like grownups...\n",
      "4.5 out of 5 stars. i generally like this product. its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. reason why i didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. seems to be a connection issue. overall, great product.\n",
      "i love it!!\n",
      "excellent product, set up with ease as well.\n",
      "nice. it works good.some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "sound quality is great. still learning about all the different things i can do with it. fun!!!\n",
      "you’re all i need...na na nana!\n",
      "works as you’d expect and then some. also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.\n",
      "i love it works very well\n",
      "this was just an additional one for my other tv. loved it so much use it on the regular tv. easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate. i don’t waste my money on regular tv cable or anything else. this is enough for me as i don’t watch too much tv.\n",
      "i really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.sometimes it misunderstands what i say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.\n",
      "i have an original echo and really like it. i wanted another one for my basement. i realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. definitely doesn't take up much room. great price for the echo plus on prime day. i ordered two!!\n",
      "it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  we admit that we have not explored all that's available through the echo.  one irritating issue is that alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer.  it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.\n",
      "i love it!!\n",
      "needs to be smarter\n",
      "it has a screen, microphones, speaker, and alexa lives inside.  yup it is an echo show.  expectations met.\n",
      "i can receive my cpr classical station.  great sound.what i like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.\n",
      "easy to set up. still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. grandkids think alex is cool!\n",
      "\n",
      "i loved it it works great\n",
      "great item for knowledge, directions, music,laughter and more\n",
      "works great! exactly as described. only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.\n",
      "these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.\n",
      "still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good\n",
      "i need to get some better controls for custom displays and the ability to make my own clock, but that's asking a lot. in general, great device; glad i got it.\n",
      "really easy to use\n",
      "very fun to use and having morning briefing\n",
      "works great\n",
      "love it to play music works great for finding recipes. need more family to have adapted machines to see\n",
      "great to wake up to music and being told the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "got one for me and for my son on prime day. we love them! i want one in every room, but that would be excessive.\n",
      "love my spot! she even more than i expected! great size for a bedroom!\n",
      "product turns on randomly and sometimes at night\n",
      "i like the interaction of asking questions. i don’t like that i can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.\n",
      "simply love my echo. i hardly watch any tv at all anymore. i'm too busy listening to music. speaker is pretty goo for its size. all the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\n",
      "i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa. i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc. to the commands from alexa. but, i really love having the music.\n",
      "kids like it for games.  showing the lyrics for songs is neat.\n",
      "the product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. the only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "love the fire stick. i can download watch great movies. instead of searching i use alexa voice.  prime doesn't offer very many newer movies is the only negative.i also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first.\n",
      "i am in love with alexa\n",
      "i will never buy anything amazon makes again!this fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. no warranty from amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. i will never buy anything built by amazon again.\n",
      "met and exceeded my expectations. easy set up and is really quick in responses.\n",
      "these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.\n",
      "better sound.\n",
      "i've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time i did use it. it was fun trying to use alexa\n",
      "i have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. i set morning alarms, check the weather, have alexa play various music (i bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and i'm learning her skills. a little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. so far, super satisfied. will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.\n",
      "fun and  information.  no dislikes  so far !! like the convenience!!\n",
      "i love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, i discovered that a lot of the channels i don't have with my cable provider is included,  and i don't have to pay extra! just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and i still come out paying way less than cable tv.\n",
      "great product and easy to use\n",
      "great product, what they don't tell you is that once you allow a &#34;drop in&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  while they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything.\n",
      "diversity, so many things to see and hear. wealth of information\n",
      "set up is so easy.\n",
      "love it it's number 4!\n",
      "everything perfect\n",
      "i love alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. i own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a significant difference in sound. the dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. i was really disappointed. i returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.\n",
      "i had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. my wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. this has been a godsend, 100%. we have the amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. we are still learning but i tell you, this is absolutely amazing. i purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on alexa. with the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. this is well worth the money. you won't regret this at all!\n",
      "music mainly but still checking other features\n",
      "i like the looks better than the original echo.  i moved my old echo to the basement family room. nice sound.\n",
      "i was hoping the cord was white also. otherwise it is fine.\n",
      "absolutely love it!!!!\n",
      "too soon, i'm still learning what i can do with it.\n",
      "easy to use. great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do....\n",
      "we regret waiting so long to purchase this item. we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.\n",
      "the voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "works perfectly\n",
      "purchased as a gift,\n",
      "love it , this time it's a gift  for friend\n",
      "we haven’t used it much yet.  we like what we have used. my husband loves it.\n",
      "love it.  great product\n",
      "have only had it set up for a few days. still adding smart home devices to it. the speaker is great for playing music. i like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.\n",
      "i love it . easy set up as well\n",
      "i haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  device tells me i need to register and i do not know what to do.\n",
      "im able to connect to prime quick\n",
      "\n",
      "when we first received this product, it was great.  however, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  if you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.\n",
      "small device that my kids like to ask questions. very handy friendly interactive\n",
      "it's an echo with a screen, hence still needs work. has me considering google home now.\n",
      "when you think about it this really doesn’t do much. play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. i can see why price is dropping like a rock.\n",
      "small speaker tin sound. great with good bluetooth speaker.\n",
      "this is a great product!  set up was easy.  sound is wonderful.\n",
      "i've had previous experience with the echo dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!it's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.\n",
      "i absolutely love my show!\n",
      "i do love it. was easy to set up so far, but i wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. there is still a whole lot more i would like to be able to do with it and i have no idea if i can or not with it. but i really do like it.\n",
      "so far, i like it.  it is better than i expecting it.\n",
      "easy to connect and the skills created for our echo 2nd gen worked fine with the dot.\n",
      "awesome, wish i had gotten one sooner.\n",
      "bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.\n",
      "once connected it brought so many options to view. we connected with quite a few of the channels.must have,\n",
      "upgraded from a first generation firestick. i don't know why i waited so long. i love it!\n",
      "i am extremely impressed with this item. bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. can't tell it even has one. works great. didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. i like the sound quality, i see some knock it. it's not a bose but it's more than great for our family. easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.can't wait to get for my classroom too! it's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what i plan to do with it.\n",
      "i never thought i was going to be that person that is completely connected. i purchased this and another echo product on prime day and fell in love.  i have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  i have already used this for morning briefings from the news while i am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  note: i did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!\n",
      "very pleased with the echo 2nd generation. it is so nice to have alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.\n",
      "whats not to like about this speaker.  just ask alexa\n",
      "good product.\n",
      "love, love, love!!!\n",
      "awesome life changer! seriously, i am able to start my morning with alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. she has gotten used to my voice, that i can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what i say. i love both my echos!!! don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. i am buying the cordless holder, so i can take the echo anywhere. love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "luv it.  it's a great product.\n",
      "works well with optional cameras.  conferencing is good.  still feel like bezos is spying on me.\n",
      "i love it. it does everything.\n",
      "love this little dot with a screen.  super easy to set up and easy to use.  instantly connected to all my other echo products.  i also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  recommended.\n",
      "fun\n",
      "recently cut the cord on cable television. needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy. instructions were short and easy to follow. i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought i'd wait and see. glad i did. wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. a few brief hiccups here and there, but i'm convinced that was from the apps themselves. don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage. thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows. so far it hasn't been any issue at all. the upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of nfl football, might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often. i'll worry about that then. my only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. the screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory. not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. haven't tried it yet, although i don't think it'll be an issue with directtv now, which i'm using right now. so far i'm loving the amazon fire stick. actually love that amazon, which i use occasionally, come pre-installed.\n",
      "haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. it will be on it's way back to amazon\n",
      "once set up very user friendly. set-up wasn't as user friendly as i'd hoped.. the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. my wife and i are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using alexa yet.\n",
      "works awesome!\n",
      "firestick easy to use and i enjoyed it.\n",
      "refurbish echo dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. neat little gadget.(drives my wife nuts!)\n",
      "does what i expected, and more.\n",
      "easy to use\n",
      "love it. the only downside is that you can't download any app you want.\n",
      "the sound is wonderful and it just plain works. i wish it cost less, but it is worth the cost. (especially on prime day)\n",
      "love it!! great product!!!\n",
      "it was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product\n",
      "i am impressed with the sound quality.\n",
      "good value\n",
      "i have been wanting one of these for a while now.  bought on prime day and absolutely love it.\n",
      "alexa rocks\n",
      "😍\n",
      "we love the show.  it loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an show issue or our internet issue.  but overall we use it for many applications.\n",
      "i purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.she enjoys all the little and big things it can do...alexa play this song, what time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!\n",
      "i love it!!\n",
      "thank you! great product!\n",
      "i haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions!\n",
      "i liked linking two more rooms in the home\n",
      "super easy to hook up and program. i use the music feature the most but i love how i can set reminders from my phone and my echo will remind me at the set time. it’s great for my news updates too!\n",
      "i am extremely impressed with this item. bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. can't tell it even has one. works great. didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. i like the sound quality, i see some knock it. it's not a bose but it's more than great for our family. easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. it integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.can't wait to get for my classroom too! it's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what i plan to do with it.\n",
      "i like having more alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.\n",
      "i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!\n",
      "love it!! perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!\n",
      "love the echo dot\n",
      "\n",
      "it works great\n",
      "very easy setup, and alexa can be heard well and receive very well.\n",
      "this thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime.\n",
      "being able to add speakers is a plus. i take it on my deck when i am outside. just love it. i have my big alexia in my bedroom\n",
      "i like almost everything\n",
      "no problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "i have had alexa since the beginning.  i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  i decided i couldn't be without an echo.  setup was easy and had it working within minutes.\n",
      "works perfect\n",
      "this echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\n",
      "home entertainment\n",
      "received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. thank you amazon.\n",
      "i decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the echo plus to control it.  i chose a kwikset 888 because amazon said it was compatible and i bought 2 dots while i was at it.  and when i posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with alexa.  what i didn't know was the z-wave lock and zigbee alexa hub weren't compatible.  does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus?  if not, i guess my choices are: 1. exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink.  2. return the whole alexa system and get something else.i  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.the reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because i was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something doesn't work.\n",
      "i love this! it’s user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used. i wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them.\n",
      "it’s great\n",
      "plug n play set up is simple. added battery base to make it portable. looking forward to using the hub.\n",
      "i bought and love them. alexa is very convenient.\n",
      "already had an echo dot. the echo is even better with fuller sound. also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!\n",
      "i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better. i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo. i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. oh well it is what it is and i still love it. i'm just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.\n",
      "i bought it for my sister and she hasn't had any complaints yet so i think it's great!\n",
      "my first smart buy..i am loving it and all the great things alexa can do.\n",
      "really like it\n",
      "excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house.\n",
      "so  convenient ! i will never touch the remote again to shut off my tv!!\n",
      "its okay but keeps dropping wifi!\n",
      "i like it\n",
      "3rd dot. love it!\n",
      "love our echo\n",
      "great to play music throughout the house. great and easily fits in my decor of my home\n",
      "this is my first alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!\n",
      "easy to setup and use. the ability to play video is huge addition on alexa device family\n",
      "it offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate 👍\n",
      "i love my alexa dot. i play games with my son, ask how the weather is and i love that she works with my amazon fire tv.\n",
      "small size works great in our sunroom.\n",
      "i like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality i expected\n",
      "i’ve been waiting for prime day to purchase an echo plus and now, i’m enjoying learning what alexa can do. with a new sonos one and an echo dot, i have the makings of a really nice and well-integrated smart home. love it!\n",
      "i love the echo dot. so easy. so fun. i get to drop in on my grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. sounds like she is right next to me.\n",
      "i was hesitant to buy the echo because i have the echo dot and it seems good enough. the echo is the same except the sound quality, which i really didn't feel i needed. however, i am so glad i got it. what a difference! the sound really is far superior to the echo dot! now i can listen to the greatest showman with a little more power!\n",
      "echo dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. i've unplugged it. it feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.\n",
      "love\n",
      "works just fine.\n",
      "terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa. not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.\n",
      "easy to set up ready to use in minutes.\n",
      "love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!\n",
      "i love having alexa around the house. my favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. especially her library of sleep sounds. i got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. she is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.the only thing i really don't like, is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function. no ifs ands, or buts. i get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as i have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. lol\n",
      "fun\n",
      "at a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  i'd understand if the volume was set higher.  all speakers get distorted when over-driven.  but this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  possibly because the bass is too high.  learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.\n",
      "need a few more\n",
      "nice product\n",
      "echo dot is a wonderful invention. we love it. alexa is so smart.\n",
      "really happy with this purchase.  great speaker and easy to set up.\n",
      "really like it,\n",
      "how easy if was to set up.\n",
      "an outstanding piece of technology, i use it everyday for information, scheduling and general information.  awesome amazon, keep improving with ai.\n",
      "it’s easier to do things with it\n",
      "didnt think id get an alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices.  it can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  its great!\n",
      "i’m never disappointed with amazons technology.\n",
      "couldn't be more pleased. amazon hit this one out of the park. looks great and runs great. love it!\n",
      "i really like this product and the fact that i can get apps that i am unable to get on my smart tv\n",
      "i love it. it is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does.\n",
      "very satisfied, easy setup. great product. highly recommend.\n",
      "very pleased with my purchase of echo smart speaker - love the fact that i can play music of different genre's whenever i want.had some trouble at first with the wi fi, but it is now working.\n",
      "i like it\n",
      "good\n",
      "this echo dot is horrible. the volume on my phone is louder than than this device. my boss has one at this is not the case\n",
      "this is my 3rd echo and with the built in hub it works great !  now i have an echo in the family room, my bedroom and my home office.\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "it’s great but sound quality is very low\n",
      "i like that it respond most of my comands. great product.\n",
      "the echo is wonderful but i'm still learning how to use it. music requests are somewhat limited.\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "i like this product. however, the set up was a bit difficult. i had to reset it to the factory setting abd start from scratch.\n",
      "my new best friend!! i'm a little behind the times i've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. i use it for my amazon audible books. set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. have her tell me a short story lol. it's pretty fun. i know some people complained about the speaker i'm not sure why. i'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. but i rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect i don't have any problems with the speaker. love everything about it!\n",
      "very easy to install and am excited to use!\n",
      "this product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) there is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;things to try&#34; -- it's an ad for other alexa services you can try. you can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) by default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. my unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.\n",
      "my kids love alexa... skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions\n",
      "excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns\n",
      "great sound for the size and the prize!! and of course....alexa!\n",
      "doesn't use apple music.  it is worthless to me without it.  sound quality on it is also poor.\n",
      "i dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.\n",
      "perfect for a home office\n",
      "we have so much fun with this!  so easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to alexa!!\n",
      "amazing. it has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.\n",
      "great product, fun to use!!\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.\n",
      "love it very much, still learning everything that my echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process.\n",
      "my husband and i are what i would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source.  wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  we've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa.  i may even buy one for my elderly dad - i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\n",
      "cool\n",
      "absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use\n",
      "love my echo great sound very smart!\n",
      "great product. wakes me up every morning on time!\n",
      "this thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying “ready for setup”. it was already setup. should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. wife not happy...\n",
      "love it!  we have other echoes and love those so i bought this on prime day!  no regrets.  love that i can connect to my ring and see the front door.  yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .\n",
      "still love it\n",
      "it works great!!\n",
      "i bought this product hoping that alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. this $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (echo buttons manual, see step 3.) the device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, i would never reccomend it. even for the $100 i spent, i feel like i got shorted. oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. i went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. i would give it zero stars if i could.\n",
      "this is my first smart device and i will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.\n",
      "this is my second echo and i love how it helps me in the kitchen. i can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.\n",
      "it was easy set up.  i use it more than i thought.\n",
      "good value\n",
      "perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!\n",
      "easy to use and fast setup\n",
      "the sound is amazing and many collections of all music\n",
      "sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub.  the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs.\n",
      "exceeded my expectations\n",
      "plenty of options to choose from!\n",
      "so far so good\n",
      "good sound works well\n",
      "overall good device. it was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. it could use a much better speaker.\n",
      "i love my echo. it's easy to operate, loads of fun.it is everything as advertised. i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexa's knowledge.\n",
      "works as advertised\n",
      "during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i couldn't resist! this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i couldn't be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"smart\" devices. thanks to her, i can control my lights, smart plugs, tv, etc. i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone. the app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! sound quality is good enough for me, since i am not an audiophile. alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. if you haven't yet, be sure to add alexa to your home!\n",
      "love it. though, wish it was portable.\n",
      "like having the music where ever i am.\n",
      "this is the 3rd unit i purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well. all my switches work great and i have had not issues. i the past, i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this. it just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. can’t wait to see what they come up with next.\n",
      "very nice gadget. love it's look.\n",
      "i really like the echo dot. it’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.\n",
      "i like that it responds every time. it was easy to set up.  i'm still learning what i can do with it. i may like a better speaker more.\n",
      "love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler\n",
      "i am the training coordinator at my company and i have used the amazon blueprints skill with an echo device and echo buttons to create my own gameshow/quiz for new hire orientation training. i'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. i believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. so far, this has been a huge success with my classes and i look forward to amazon improving and building out the blueprints skill further!\n",
      "love love love this!  i have an echo, and several echo dots, but love the video with this and the clock.  i no longer have to wake up and say &#34;alexa, what time is it?&#34; or &#34;alexa, weather&#34;  i can even watch videos on it if i forget my kindle before bed.\n",
      "we have only been using alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. it like having a new household member! we are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\n",
      "fantastic product, i use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program\n",
      "it is a great bundle of fun. music ,games, questions etc. i luv it turns off my smart lights. i purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!\n",
      "our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  what fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. however, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features.  you can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;things to try&#34;.  instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;try ......&#34;.  amazon, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam!\n",
      "it plays music that i request.\n",
      "the voice recognition is amazing, perfect companion for the bedroom.\n",
      "i love love love love it!  i feel like i have a talking computer that tells me everything.\n",
      "we like it better than roku.  voice commands really work.\n",
      "responds easily and like the ability to do at night.\n",
      "excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on prime day.\n",
      "six words, &#34;alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;\n",
      "the sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. i would recommend to get the echo dot and buy a better speaker instead. maybe sonos and use the echo dot.\n",
      "this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.overall a great addition to my smart home. its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. i have a bunch of other alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.\n",
      "love the echo !!! i love the size, material and speaker quality. i have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. next is echo dot for bedroom. there is a lot more to do with echo that you think. traffic, weather, trivia, etc.\n",
      "works and sounds great.\n",
      "i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day. i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology. the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can't use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. i am connected to both 2.4ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works. it's very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could. if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!\n",
      "i am quite disappointed by this product.there clearly is a bug: half of the time i ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. same goes when i ask to play the radio. also, many times it get confused when i ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. clearly no ai or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. not impressed!\n",
      "superb is all we can say.  plugged the unit in, set up the hdmi and boom, we were watching better tv.  thank you.\n",
      "amazing!\n",
      "great speaker i n this! i love this so much more than my alexa tap! it’s definitely fast in response and just so much prettier\n",
      "i have had no problems with my echo plus. would purchase it again.\n",
      "we like the video calling feature. we got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well\n",
      "supberb sound! definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.\n",
      "we love the fire tv stick and will love it even more when we sever our cable connection when our service agreement expires.\n",
      "hands free calling in the house. i misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing. really enjoying the streaming music.\n",
      "fun to use, good sound quality\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "i bought this for my mother and she loves it! i want to get one for myself now!\n",
      "to have ability to play amazon music outside for patio gatherings. i also used blue tooth to connect echo plus via alexa app on my tablet to an external speaker when/if the party extends into the yard. i have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "this worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.\n",
      "i’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. there’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!\n",
      "i love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier\n",
      "it’s easier to do things with it\n",
      "this is a very useful device.  i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  it works with all the other alexa devices, so i can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. i enjoy it much more than i thought i would.\n",
      "only complaint i have is that the sound quality isn't great. i mostly use it for commands though, and i have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. i have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing i'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.\n",
      "love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!\n",
      "beyond my capabilities to program. grandkids lve it\n",
      "super easy to set up.  easy to use. lots of app options available.\n",
      "we really only use this as a speaker to stream music. we’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.\n",
      "great product and prime day price! took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other echo devices in my home. this came with a philips smart bulb. it's better than having a clapper! i found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. very easy to set it up with the instructions. you even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!\n",
      "i liked it, perfect size, the screen is really clear,  and elegant.\n",
      "easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.\n",
      "perfect condition!\n",
      "my new best friend!! i'm a little behind the times i've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. i use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. i use it for my amazon audible books. set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. have her tell me a short story lol. it's pretty fun. i know some people complained about the speaker i'm not sure why. i'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. but i rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect i don't have any problems with the speaker. love everything about it!\n",
      "easy setup, works flawlessly!\n",
      "wish volume was capable of going louder\n",
      "like google better\n",
      "the product is attractive and somewhat useful, but, amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and trending”.  this greatly depreciates the value of the product.  do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from amazon.\n",
      "my husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  i wish we knew all it's capabilities\n",
      "invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! creapy af\n",
      "worked just as good as the two new echo dots i preciously purchases.\n",
      "i'll be returning it.  it's been nothing but annoying.  the hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge.  i can't even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so.  there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  it doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness i knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  i found that rather interesting.\n",
      "still learning what it can do. amazing. simple, works right out of a box. only frustration is getting amazon alexa app t show up on my samsung/galaxy with google's android.\n",
      "alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. speech recognition fails to understand basic american and british accent.the music it can play is very restrictive. speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. linking to youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.\n",
      "nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot, my dots can hear me from across the house the show does not, that being said i love the show!!i can watch tv and movies while in tg ed kitchen, have the news playing or music....love....it !!\n",
      "i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also. it is the best thing i ever did, i use them on each side of the house! and couldn't be happier!\n",
      "love the feature to play music in every room with multiple echos.\n",
      "love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. great to drop in on family around the house.\n",
      "it works ok. this speaker quality is not much better than my iphone x. i would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.\n",
      "starting my day!\n",
      "i loved it does exactly what it says\n",
      "alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time\n",
      "we originally got the show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. we have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. so far we have really liked the show, and would recommend it!\n",
      "i am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. will send it back if i cant get help. my eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.i just wanted a bigger speaker.\n",
      "from such a small speaker it sounds great\n",
      "i've had the first gen echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. i purchased the 2nd gen during prime day and so far i'm happy. it seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.\n",
      "some times alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!\n",
      "its was easy to set up\n",
      "i purchased the echo plus with built-in hub during prime days sale. it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi. also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. i love telling alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. excited to learn new uses for it.\n",
      "we love everything\n",
      "use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home\n",
      "i replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...i was wrong.  if anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  good product.\n",

      "i absolutely love this thing. and i love amazon because my echo show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. i was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. alexa still talked but i couldn't watch movies. so happy that amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "handy if you don't expect much out of it much \"dumber\" than the assistant in my phone.\n",

      "just the perfect cost effective solution.  thank you amazon.\n",
      "this product replaces the 1st generation fire stick i had, and what an improvement in speed in both showing amazon content but all apps downloaded on product! i bought in on prime day for $19 .... best deal ever !\n",

      "so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app\n",
      "it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. a lot of the skills are excellent. i've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access youtube.it might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. i imagine this is a functionality people would use often.\n",

      "refurbished is the way to go. my echo works just like new.\n",
      "this is very hard to review because i am part of the  problem.i am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when i am not home.i am computer literate, itunes literate, amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to alexa.  i think i heard her sigh in exasperation.i tried to create a playlist of songs i like only to have it ignored.  i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.i have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic alexa than am i.so far, i like what i have been able to use but i'd like it a lot more if i could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the amazon/alexa default.karen\n",

      "music. news. shopping list. jokes. games\n",
      "i own the first and second generation echo dot.  i think i prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price i got it for.  i'd still definitely recommend.\n",
      "the greatest\n",
      "love the product but dislike that i can’t sync up my apple music for alexa to play\n",
      "looks great\n",
      "love my alexa! actually have 3 throughout the house. favorite function is lists. great for time management and if course, music.\n",
      "love it! i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, i could not pass it up! it's fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music. you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker. i've been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\n",
      "omg where do i start, i love this thing! none bad to say!\n",
      "the echo spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient! it reminds me of any appointments, warns me about traffic snarls, and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists.\n",
      "home\n",
      "i like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audible.i am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quot;notification&quot; sound but when i ask alexa to read my notifications, she tells me that there are no new notifications.  this has happened at least once a day for over a week now.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "the alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. it could definitely be louder.\n",

      "it f****** sucks\n",
      "it's like siri, in fact, siri answers more accurately then alexa.  i don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\n",
      "i love my echo. it's easy to operate, loads of fun.it is everything as advertised. i use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test alexa's knowledge.\n",
      "i love all of the things that it can do. i can play with it and learn from it.\n",

      "i am thoroughly enjoying my ecoo!  love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then i can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.\n",

      "i love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices\n",
      "love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify. she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs.\n",
      "we have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;alexa&#34; or &#34;computer&#34; are a little annoying.  more colors then black and white would also be a good thing.\n",
      "it is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions.\n",

      "alarm and music, information the weather\n",

      "barry\n",
      "have alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!\n",
      "great in the kitchen.  i love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  also great for listening to music and watching shows on amazon prime video while i cook.  i subsequently bought an echo dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  i created a group so i can play music on both of them at the same time.  i plan to add more speakers in the future.\n",

      "love it! very helpful\n",
      "good shape\n",
      "i bought this for my healing room.  i play continuous spa like music. although alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  i didn't know i had to buy speakers too.\n",
      "it's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything i ask but it's still nice to use.\n",
      "great\n",

      "its great. lots of fun!!\n",

      "i love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  i enjoyed it so much that i ordered another.\n",
      "great product and i would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but i like having other cards as well. god its the worst and so irritating.  i got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a dot instead of a spot.  what a dumb move on amazons​ part.\n",
      "great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  tunes and information instantly available.  slowly learning more features.\n",
      "love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask alexa to turn the light off.\n",
      "purchased this for a discount on prime day to insert into a portable bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with echo dot. works great, love it! now i can bring alexa out onto the patio with me, and i mostly use it for music. this is our 3rd echo product and we love them!\n",
      "i love my echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\n",
      "i bought this to replace a &#34;dot&#34; in my living room. speaker is slightly better. it hears me better over the tv. unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot. i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want. the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request. i don't consider it an upgrade.\n",
      "i got this on prime day and figured i'd see what all the hype is about.  honestly i didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, i love it.  like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.i loved it so much i ordered 2.  i didn't get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where i can just say play any song i want and it will.  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  i'd love for it to display the weather as i listen to music.the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  i have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  so it really works great.the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet.  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot - the dot lights up colors - why can't the spot ?  the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.overall it's a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around.  i'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can't tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration.\n",
      "i’m having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn’t work, the timer doesn’t ends... and alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is so much fun to play with - i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of - alexa learns from the questions i ask. she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it. when i want the current weather she tells me. ask her what going on in the city she knows. call a friend she will dial ( i haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.\n",
      "access to apps\n",
      "i got my echo spot on prime day and love it. i think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. i basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. i also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. i'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some star trek sounds (alexa, beam me up) which are fun!\n",
      "love my new alexa. she works great so far.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "i love this, it's quick and easy to use. i love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. i also love the music app on here. i didn't think i would use it because i have alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. but i tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! love it!!\n",
      "i like the whole thing so far\n",
      "i own two dots, a tap and a show. i love the echo show. sound quality is amazing compared to the dots. i use mine constantly to create shopping list, kitchen and laundry timer, and news updates. but most of all i have the all throughout the house and i play music throughout using the group settings\n",
      "great\n",
      "i like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song i can think of and much more. i wish the sound could be a tad louder.\n",
      "great product, need a bit a adjustment to set up spotify, time, weather, etc.. in hong kong, but works fine now. i used it as alarm clock + music in bedroom, love it.\n",
      "it takes a while to learn the uses and i'm still learning!\n",
      "love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify. she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs.\n",
      "very helpful with daily activities\n",
      "get this in white. i bought it for my girlfriend in white and i wish i had it in white now. alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it's not around. i find new uses for alexa every day. i've incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life. as alexa learns more i learn more. she's my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. i'm constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics etc. she turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home.\n",
      "works great, but i don't think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) have prime and 2) buy an echo.\n",
      "it’s very smart and sweet design\n",
      "great device, responsive and helpful\n",
      "i love it!  i wanted it primarily for the kitchen.  in addition to other common services i wanted it to use allrecipes and cook's illustrated recipes\n",
      "everyone should have an echo or two or three or more. i bought my echo through qvc.\n",
      "very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\n",
      "i am very pleased with the fire stick.\n",
      "doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. i thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.\n",
      "it’s smaller than the original. looks nicer too.\n",
      "easy to install\n",
      "i like the list ability and the music i can play.  i do not like that i can not create a playlist without using the app and even then alexa will not play my songs i have to do it through my tablet or phone.  i also do not like that alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.\n",
      "love it. it is in my kitchen so i can watch prime video while cooking.\n",
      "i am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while i walked on the treadmill.\n",
      "love my echo. still learning all the things it will do. wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on u-tube.\n",
      "great\n",
      "it works\n",
      "love it! very helpful\n",
      "plays great\n",
      "i'm amazed with the alarm. i tell alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  i love the play list if music. not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. however i did love the fact amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.\n",
      "absolutly love it !\n",
      "i love it!!!\n",
      "easy to set up and use,\n",
      "love it\n",
      "i am so disappointed in this product.  i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  hours with amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  the app didn't connect the echo plus to the internet connection.  tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a chromebook... no luck.  there are no clean directions on the application.  probably sending this back to amazon..mark this as not ready for prime time.\n",
      "i have used roku & mi tv box. this fire tv stick is very similar. easy to use.\n",
      "love being able to listen to music easily. still learning all the features available\n",
      "eh. it’s works on and off. half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. other then that works fine\n",
      "the firestick we were sent doesn’t work. at all.  voice remote won’t even turn on. we did all the troubleshooting steps. didn’t work. contacted amazon. they sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! we gave up and got a roku (which works great!)\n",
      "i think it can read my mind\n",
      "smaller than i thought it would be. happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.\n",
      "all of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. asking any echo device to play music on sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. this went on for two weeks until i eventually solved the problem that neither amazon nor sonos could figure out.\n",
      "i replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...i was wrong.  if anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  good product.\n",

      "works great, but i don't think amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) have prime and 2) buy an echo.\n",
      "i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, i have 4 other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly, i have reset my phone (galaxy s8), checked the app for updates, i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt. i work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the echo and try again. i figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....i hope they won't call me i'll tell em to send the product back!\n",
      "versatile and fun !!!\n",
      "i am really enjoying the many different features on my alexa, especially listening to music and audio books\n",
      "i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot. alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions i have asked i get the &#34;i'm not sure&#34;  half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying &#34;i'm not sure&#34;. the music is great and works well for that. all in all so far it's been a very frustrating experience.\n",
      "we were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. how nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. looking forward to exploring other options with this device.\n",
      "my son loves his echo dot.\n",
      "the echo does not link to direct tv even though they said it would. i have spent multiple hours on this. made phone calls and texts. also is missing free bulb.\n",

      "very satisfied with the echo. alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa.\n",
      "these things are great!\n",
      "i've already returned it.\n",
      "working good so far.\n",
      "we love alexa! we use her to play music, play radio through itunes, play podcasts through anypod, and set reminders. we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. we rely on our custom lists. we like being able to voice control the volume. we're sure we'll continue to find new uses.sometimes it's a bit frustrating when alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\n",
      "we like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\n",
      "it seems to work well.  unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or youtube any more.  this problem is caused by google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  this even effected my smart tv.  anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out.\n",
      "i wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  but the font is too small to see from any distance.  and apparently you can't change it.\n",
      "great product. i have two and may want to buy a third!\n",
      "it get on sale after 2 days so ... check events before u buy these amazon products!\n",
      "i would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through “things to try”. if amazon would make this a setting i would change my review to 5 stars.\n",
      "i enjoy it. still discovering new uses.\n",
      "we regret waiting so long to purchase this item. we are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.\n",
      "small convenient and dependable. this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you ask.my only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker\n",
      "the volume is very low\n",
      "love it. it's like having a second wife.\n",
      "happy with this as i was with the other 2 i ordered!!\n",
      "so far so good,  much better sound than my echo dot\n",
      "i really like it .\n",
      "i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub. i'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. for the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. i got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. i haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but i've already found myself using many of them. when i started a search for a hub. i wasn't even considering the echo. in part, because i didn't know it was a hub. but also because i didn't really think i would find much use for another ai system. if you're looking for a hub. why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? oh! and by the way. for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone. i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. given the price of these extras. well, that just put the echo plus over the top.\n",
      "my 90 year old mom loves that she can watch the 1st season of blue bloods ❤. my one wish is that she could watch csi:miami...without having to pay for it...😥 the bill for optimum is already, quite high. can you help us? we live on long island, ny (suffolk county )\n",
      "have had for just one week so far and i can say it is a blast to have.\n",

      "technology in such a small device. the price was good too! the sound is amazing! a must have feature for any home!\n",
      "we love the size of the 2nd generation echo. still needs a little improvement on sound\n",
      "un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet.\n",
      "very satisfied with the purchase. the package came in good time and was just as expected\n",
      "this is the best amazon speaker with alexa in it.  but if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong. are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell alexa to turn them on and off. that’s it! you’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.\n",
      "very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\n",

      "device is touted as able to link to calendar on my samsung phone through google, can't get it to work\n",
      "works as you’d expect and then some. also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.\n",

      "4.5 out of 5 stars. i generally like this product. its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. reason why i didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. seems to be a connection issue. overall, great product.\n",
      "love all my echo products. i like the video phone feature on this. can check in on our cat when on vacation.\n",
      "the sound is amazing and many collections of all music\n",
      "i got this for my mom . she loves it !\n",
      "works great and simple to set up. alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so im using it more than i thought. wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.no she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. the speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.\n",
      "my husband and i are what i would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and echo to serve primarily as a music source.  wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  we've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking alexa.  i may even buy one for my elderly dad - i think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\n",

      "i like the volume up and down on the top so i can turn it down quickly.\n",

      "love it.\n",
      "the echo plus is great! so easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command. i am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. definitely recommend the echo plus!\n",

      "love it!! still learning all the possibilities.\n",

      "it makes talking with your grandchildren so easy, especially for the little ones.  outstanding product!\n",
      "sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  i like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.\n",
      "totally gets out sense of humour\n",
      "i love my echo dot!  the price i paid during prime day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  i can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  definitely worth the money.\n",
      "my  wife & i enjoy the ease of playing our music. the games are fun & entertaining, i look forward to adding more smart products to my home.\n",

      "started here with amazon productsand i regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life\n",
      "works great. easy set up.\n",
      "i love the number of movies that are available using this device. took me a little time to setup and learn how to work it. the only thing i miss is local channels.\n",
      "easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. despite its small size the speakers are adequate. understands instructions from across the room. very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "absolutely love!!\n",
      "i love the echo show!! i have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the show is so much better.  the sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4k tv.  i love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  i purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  when the dot was given to me, i thought \"this is a cute novelty,  but i'll probably never use it\". was i wrong!!  echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier.\n",
      "sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "i love this item... i underestimated this item, i have another 2 in my cart ... but i'm waiting for the same deal again!!!, i highly recommend this item!\n",
      "i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo. if you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a \"smart home\". the voice recognition is very impressive. it is stylish and fun. i have no regrets with this purchase. it is great for technically changes people. ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. if you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  if you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! you can even have conversations with the echo. i am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke. it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\n",
      "works great but speaker is not the good for music. will need to get a bluetooth speaker.\n",
      "i love this technology. i'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. i have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything i use my echo for which is in the living room.\n",
      "awesome product!\n",
      "easy to set up; easy to use!\n",
      "easy set up very user friendly\n",
      "easy to set-up and to use.\n",
      "the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  i bought two and the reason i only rate it a 3 is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  i know i've done it correctly but they won't sync.  that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\n",
      "it was smaller than i had anticipated, and when i say that i very much mean it. however, it still works very well! quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.\n",
      "i loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! simply amazing.  so amazing we bought two!this allowed us to officially \"cut the cable cord\".love it!\n",
      "alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. at least i have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 though i wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.\n",
      "i love it and it works great, the only issue is the “drop in” facetime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my wifi for where we have it located in the house.\n",
      "i really like the echo dot. it’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.\n",
      "fun item to play with and get used to using.  sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but i think it will be better.\n",
      "i received the echo in perfect condition. the device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. alexa is a great addition to our family!\n",
      "very fast service,  got what i ordered. thank you\n",

      "i can't live without alexa.\n",
      "have alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!\n",
      "i am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of alexa. the unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with tv or music playing.i did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. fidelity is very good for the size.my only regret is that i would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue.\n",
      "love it! i’ve listened to songs i haven’t heard since childhood! i get the news, weather, information! it’s great!\n",
      "dont trust this....\n",
      "so far i like it.  i bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.\n",
      "i love using my echo show for music, it sounds amazing! unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great, my husband and i video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated. i'm still learning to use it but so far so good.\n",
      "like new, good refurbishing\n",
      "the first one quit working shortly after i got it. the next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. i am not sure if it just this dot or they are all this way.\n",
      "it still doesn’t work.  i bet if i call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "works great to watch youtube and amazin video\n",
      "i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb.  the excited ended quickly.  i spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus.  everything i tried, ended in a discovery failed message.  i tried to set this up over and over and over again.  i watched youtube videos.  i read set up websites.  i was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support.  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  this product has tested my patience.  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb.  the problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, i purchased another bulb and still alexa couldn't locate this device.i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating, but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo?  the support person had the same thought.  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can't get over the look of that hub.  it looks like a defuser.i can't believe i didn't find youtube videos that show the problems i did.  everything looked simple and seamless...not the experience i had.  ok, i'm done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\n",
      "very nice and its does not take up space\n",
      "i love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when i don’t get off the couch\n",

      "home entertainment\n",
      "this product has made my life much simpler with a little one. i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze. the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news!\n",
      "it's like a remedial form of the star trek computer in your home\n",
      "we love this thing! i wish i would have gotten it sooner. you will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. there are loads of skills. i am very happy with this purchase, especially since i got it on prime day for almost half price.\n",
      "i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth. the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. then  i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device.\n",
      "more compact and a bit better than the original\n",

      "awesome product\n",

      "i purchased the fire stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience. i love that there is such a variety of genres. i also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch tv shows too. it's awesome!\n",
      "love my new addition to the house! speaker quality is great and over all we love our alexa. my only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. example: for our smart lights in the house. unless we specify kitchen light 1 or kitchen light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. it may be me, but i want my alexa to respond when i say thank you afterwards. i have to repeat alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. i know it sounds odd. we laugh about it, but maybe it’s a southern thing but i want my alexa to have manners too.\n",
      "i'm still learning how to use it.  i figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.\n",
      "this was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and i really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. a bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, i used it like i use my other, screenless echos.... for a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. a quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.long story short, i moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. so like the headline suggests... meh.\n",
      "i really love my amazon echo. i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!\n",
      "the sound from this echo 2nd generation is phenomenal!  not to mention that i just love alexa!  she is very helpful.\n",
      "this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices.  how disappointing!\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "i use the echo dot several different ways in my home. i use it downstairs to control lighting. i also take it out on my deck to stream music to a bluetooth speaker. it works great for what i need.\n",
      "this item did not work. certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in. when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.\n",
      "i like it all\n",
      "it was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!\n",
      "love it!!! convenient. responsive. learns voices within the household. best assistant so far!\n",

      "works great! alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!\n",
      "easy setup and sound quality.\n",
      "i'm obsessed with alexa. she tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our tv downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if alexa will do it for you????\n",
      "so i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you.\n",
      "i love it. it does everything\n",
      "i use it primarily to play music.  it works wonderfully!  still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  amazon has sent several tips since i got it. thanks for all your help!\n",
      "a great investment. alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.\n",
      "it's fantastic. very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "glad i bought this.\n",
      "the speaker sounds really good\n",
      "easy to set up ready to use in minutes.\n",
      "really like it. the screen is a major plus.\n",
      "love it!\n",
      "well i’m a big fan of echoes these ones went i’m my bathrooms.  works just great as expected 👍🏾\n",
      "after purchasing my echo spot to add to our other 4 amazon echoes...i am very pleased with the echo spot...i use  it with our arlo security cameras and ring video doorbell and works without any problems...\n",
      "works as expected. this is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.\n",
      "love, love, love my amazon echo plus!!❤️❤️\n",
      "\n",
      "awesome thing, love alexa\n",
      "easy to setup. love all the things she does.\n",
      "great product. sometimes alexa does not understand some commands for my fire tv. all in all, this is a fabulous speaker.\n",
      "great addition to my alexa base. using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value\n",
      "love the product idea. super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). the sound is good where imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. there is one thing i hate & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask alexa. unless you have her turn off the screen totally which i do when i go to bed. and it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. not attractive. the echo show was on sale prior to prime day for less than the echo, so i figured i was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, i would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the echo. i may still exchange the product.\n",
      "love it.\n",
      "my android would not allow alexa to connect. fortunately, my sister was here with her apple cell. after an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. we are up and running.\n",
      "very amazing product. great sound quality.\n",
      "great product, fun to use!!\n",
      "\n",
      "i really love my dots! so awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. but like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. which i’m sure if i connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. but as a stand alone the volume is just ok. definitely not like my tall echo. and the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.still totally love them and would recommend 100%\n",
      "i am very excited and happy with this. it was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my kindle and going to sleep to thunderstorm music.\n",
      "love being able to see, as well as hear things.  sound is better, too!\n",
      "works on great i  use it with my arlo security system\n",
      "\n",
      "love it!! super fun! easy to use! my three year old even gets involved\n",
      "great fun but frustrating at times. commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) also would like more video options with flash briefings. still really a tech wonder for a low price.\n",
      "whats not to like about this speaker.  just ask alexa\n",
      "not perfect but very good! a few times alexa picked up something from tv, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. if you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; echo plus has no problems as a smart hub but i could use better user directions. well worth owning and a good step to making my home smart!\n",
      "easy set up, nice looking interface and i like the new slightly larger remote. i have a 1st gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. and great price!\n",
      "upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. happy with sound\n",
      "great product and fast shipping. thank you\n",
      "we have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  can't wait to try more new stuff using alexa!\n",
      "easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do\n",
      "simply amazing what a awsome device. it never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. drop in on the kids and keep in touch. i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.\n",
      "bought the spot and loved it. within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. i was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions. told to wait longer. really????  unacceptable—expected more from amazon. find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance.\n",
      "i set up the echo dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. do not buy refurbished!!!! i sent back for return the day after i received.\n",
      "the best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  there isn’t anything i dislike.\n",
      "bought it for my mother\n",
      "very responsive. great sound quality for its size.\n",
      "love being able to listen to music easily. still learning all the features available\n",
      "i bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.she loves the guard dog feature.she says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house\n",
      "much easier to use than the dot. it picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding the screen is a nice perk but i only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..it displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  my only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. i didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.many people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i'm not going to split hairs.  the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. i think amazon is working overtime on this project. i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.i am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  alexa, what time is it?  alexa???!!\n",
      "i love alexa and when i had the chance to add show to my home... i jumped at it.  but... i'm a member and my show doesn't know i paid for the extras with my echo (now in the upstairs bedroom.  if i am supposed to pay more for having show added to my home, then i'm afraid to ask &#34;what's the point?&#34;\n",
      "two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  no connection, no light, no sound.  i guess i shouldn't have purchased a refurbished dot.\n",
      "works great and easy to set up!\n",
      "very satisfied with the echo. alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to jimmy buffet by just asking alexa.\n",
      "love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  connected to my echo dot i enjoy listening in multiple rooms.\n",
      "still learning it\n",
      "&#34;never buy certified and refurbished echo dot &#34; i bought a &#34;certified and refurbished &#34; echo dot. this unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. never buy a refurbished echo dot. the unit i received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. i also bought a new echo dot, it works perfectly.very disappointed !!!!\n",
      "did t really know what i could use this device for. used it for a few things, but need an overview\n",
      "wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.\n",
      "i already have an alexa and with amazon find today i could not resist getting an echo also. it is the best thing i ever did, i use them on each side of the house! and couldn't be happier!\n",
      "great sound and video!\n",
      "can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. this  is a big promotion device for amazon.  packing it up and sending it back.  they really want to get in our heads.  enough already.\n",
      "i really love my amazon echo. i think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. it is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!\n",
      "just what i expected....\n",
      "small convenient and dependable. this dot is a cutie and alexa does the job you ask.my only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker\n",
      "still needs some work on commands. sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.\n",
      "i love my echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\n",
      "super easy set up and am loving our new echo!\n",
      "we’ve had the original echo for quite some time and just recently added the show.  it was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  the echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  i look forward to expanding on that capability.  we also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  i haven’t used the show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.\n",
      "i love all the viewing choices on fire stick!\n",
      "returned from repair with no repair done. it has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.i sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  the site gives no option to complain from the page.i have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.\n",
      "easy to use and has great sound...it was a great purchase at a great price.\n",
      "great buy at $20!\n",
      "perfect for a home office\n",
      "works great\n",
      "very responsive. great sound quality for its size.\n",
      "dislike the volume. it does not sound loud enough.\n",
      "very nice-needs some work\n",
      "doesn't work with my fairly new smart tv, but that's mainly the tv manufacturers(lg) fault due to not supporting anything older than tvs from this year. my smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. speakers sound great and works very well.\n",
      "easy to use--amazing\n",
      "works like a charm.\n",
      "sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "sad joke. worthless.\n",
      "great deal, great product!\n",
      "wish there were more skills\n",
      "i love love love it.\n",
      "really like the show me feature. i also like video calls with others.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "i love it!\n",
      "cheap and cheap sound.\n",
      "simple install and love the voice activation\n",
      "i like the option for white, but it’s bizarre that it comes with a black cord. i have a white kitchen, so now i have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. for aesthetic purposes, i was happier with my year-old white echo (not show) because it came with a white powercord. this seems like a major design flaw in the “white” option. i strongly urge amazon to change out the powercord to white.\n",
      "outstanding product - easy to use.  works great\n",
      "one problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect\n",
      "the outlet does not work with it. was disappointed in that.\n",
      "i love the alexa remote and easy to use.\n",
      "easy to set up, can control kasa smart plugs no problem.  even the kids have figured stuff out that i would not have asked alexa, like telling jokes and singing. the alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "like the little spot,  now our guest room is alexa enabled.\n",
      "love it! i personally prefer spotify music, so it’s great that i was able to set that as default. there’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. he’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. it’s a must have!\n",
      "work pretty well\n",
      "i love the way it is designed. and you have choices for the face.  i use it for my bed side.  i drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.\n",
      "bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room. love them both. the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. shows lyrics, photos , etc. i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it.\n",
      "looked brand new works great. i love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new\n",
      "had a little trouble at the beginning until i replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  like when it was 91 degrees, alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from amazon and my pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "a great product for the price, works well!!\n",
      "love it just as good as a new one\n",
      "have had this around a week.. i love that i can control items in my house even if i’m not there.. makes me feel better about being away from the house and people don’t know that we are gone.. alexa has not disappointed!\n",
      "sound is great,video is great. now i just need to learn everything it can do. where can i see videos (youtube), listen to music. watch the news\n",
      "\n",
      "great product at a great price.\n",
      "ease of use and many tasks it will perform\n",
      "this refurbished item was fine,but i wasn't aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms.  however, it was missing the cordthank you\n",
      "love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. it is awesome have used it for everything my lights since i work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. and planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... i would recommend this to everyone!!!!\n",
      "beyond awesome\n",
      "i love alexa!  i am surprised how much i use her.\n",
      "alarm, calendar, reminders\n",
      "love it as i do all of my echos\n",
      "we've owned a number of echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  we just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  we now use these as bedside clocks.\n",
      "yet another exho for our home and love them all!!!\n",
      "i enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different amazon music stations\n",
      "we went to a best buy with the intention of buying alexa products, instead were talked into the google home products. bought the google home and the home mini... has trouble from the start setting them up, and they couldn’t understand my husband (scottish accent). after days of the “oops, something went wrong” command.. we returned them and bought the amazon echo show and the echo plus... so easy to set up! it connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. they both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message. we have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place! you won’t regret your purchase!\n",
      "i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. i'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.it would be great to have updates to our little a.i.'s, i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. thank you\n",
      "works great in my large open room\n",
      "the firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up.  i like the platform and feel it is better than i expected.  i was worried about it lagging but it has not at all.  i’m hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now i’m more confident that it can happen.\n",
      "este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol\n",
      "small size works great in our sunroom.\n",
      "third echo dot purchased. love the product.\n",
      "i like that it respond most of my comands. great product.\n",
      "good but it’s pretty low\n",
      "i am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while i walked on the treadmill.\n",
      "i have a friend now.\n",
      "woohoo! $20 on prime day; done!\n",
      "i love it!!\n",
      "as described and received on time.  do not like automatic enrolment into music.\n",
      "it’s still a great product.but the sound quality does seem worse.don’t get me wrong. you definitely get used to it within an hour. but it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.besides that , it’s great.with the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi, it’s even better.\n",
      "my mom bought a few echo dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. i told her “no” for two days. when she made me take it, 6 hours later i could not live my life without it!  it’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small echo dot, that i will be returning to her. i say if you’re going to order an alexa speaker, go big and get the echo, otherwise tou’ll be returning the two echo dots you couldn’t live without.\n",
      "i’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but i’m not exactly tech smart. i’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. so far i’ve been using it mostly for music.\n",
      "i have 3-dots and 2-original and this new one works perfectly.  will buy all my future dots reconditioned.\n",
      "wonderful product and fast delivery!\n",
      "i have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my daughter. absolutely love it. especially for the video chat.\n",
      "up dated news\n",
      "hands free control\n",
      "\n",
      "no problems, works as expected. could have a better speaker.\n",
      "i don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  but it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  but if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but i don't understand why i can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker.  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker.\n",
      "awesome product! i am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and the show is now my favorite device!\n",
      "we have a great time using this as a family. even my toddler can talk to her . there are a few features i wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the google home !\n",
      "the commands alexa requires are too specific.  i find google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what i'm asking for.\n",
      "great sound for the size and the prize!! and of course....alexa!\n",
      "same as new\n",
      "fairly useless.\n",
      "purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  so far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\n",
      "home entertainment.\n",
      "love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!\n",
      "love it and alexa. i am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.\n",

      "works beautifully, excellent sound.\n",
      "music, weather, time.\n",
      "bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.\n",
      "son loves it.\n",
      "so far it seems to be a very nice item. it picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. the other day i asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. i've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\n",
      "granddaughter loves it\n",
      "i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day. i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology. the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can't use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. i am connected to both 2.4ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works. it's very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could. if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!\n",

      "does everything i could ask and more. great product.\n",

      "this echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\n",
      "i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day. i have not been disappointed! it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "awesome life changer! seriously, i am able to start my morning with alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. she has gotten used to my voice, that i can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what i say. i love both my echos!!! don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. i am buying the cordless holder, so i can take the echo anywhere. love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",

      "love alexa hope have her in every room soon.\n",
      "very cool and lots of fun! used for a week and still learning its capabilities.\n",
      "was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. the one challenge with the hub is that phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. basic functionality works with this unit, but now i need two apps to set everything how i want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. it's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which i find highly unsettling. we have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.the speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. the sleek design is not obtrusive. my girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.\n",
      "excellent product, set up with ease as well.\n",
